t1_ch7cvu3,1,4,1,0,"My most recent high school reunion was canceled due to lack of interest. The senior class president, who is in charge of organizing reunions, had to write a refund check to everyone who had already purchased a ticket. I know that at least 50 people paid for tickets. So that means she has 50+ checks floating around out there for over $1,000. These checks do not show up on your online account statements until they have been cashed or deposited.   You might think people would go deposit these checks right away, but people are weird. Sometimes people wait weeks or even months to deposit a check. They just keep forgetting or something, I don't know. Anyway, that is a long enough time that you can't keep a rough mental record of what checks have been cashed and what checks are still out there.   Also, you have no control over *when* the checks get cashed. With your debit card, you know if you are running low. So you know not to use it. If you are running low and 10 people decide to cash their checks at once, you will get slammed with bounced check fees.   ----  edit: It might not seem like a big deal now, but I write a lot more checks now that I am out of school. "
t1_ch7ddwy,1,1,1,0,"I guess I should add that the only time I use the check register is when I write a check, which does not happen very often due to the convenience of the debit card. How does this change my situation?"
t1_cai3dw5,5,5,4,1,"A while ago around my junior / senior year in high school  we ha to do some sort of community service (being a catholic school and all). So i ended up doing some volunteer work at a homeless shelter. Now before this my experience with people who were homeless was very limited and i would say a bit negative. Homeless people. Seemed to me as just people who were drug addicts / alcoholics / etc. so anyway back to volunteering at the shelter. I ended up talking with a few guys about their lives and pasts and it was fascinating the things that they had done and also the unfortunate circumstances / decisions that led to where they are now. I also ended up playing a 3 hour game of chess which ended in a stalemate. Most of these guys were really intelligent and it surprised me to some degree. Anyway after that my view of those who are homeless has shifted a lot to seeing each person as an individual with their own unique past and not simply as a collective of people who are homeless, and that there are a lot of hard working homeless people out there who have jobs and families but they just can't afford the cost o living. "
t1_cai5p4w,1,1,1,0,"I held the same view when I was younger as well. I'm black, so it hit me pretty hard when I read a sarcastic comment that was something along the lines of: ""Civil unions are fine because separate but equal worked so well in the past."""

I still believe Google should, for its own good, develop a podcast app. But I'm coming at it from a different angle now, which is that Google needs to re-evaluate its decision. You deserve a ∆ for making me shift my position so significantly. "
t1_caumnu6,4,3,1,1,"I don't follow the case but I can suggest a couple points based off of what you talked about  &gt;What doesn't seem plausible to me, is that a man who was taking MMA classes three times a week, had no means to defend himself while pinned downed in a ground and pound position  There is an immense difference between training and what you perceive as a life or death situation. You are going to be running off of instinct, it's like how a drowning man will try to pull down someone who is trying to save him. Also, I've heard that since there aren't any certifications for martial arts, it's a big issue that there are scams which aren't really teaching anything useful but this was from a cracked article so take it with a grain of salt.  &gt;What seems even less plausible to me is that Trayvon was all at once suffocating Zimmerman, slamming his head against the ground, and reaching for Zimmerman's gun while telling Zimmerman, ""you're going to die tonight.""   Well the thing is, Trayvon probably wasn't but that doesn't mean Zimmerman is lying. He was placed in a high stress situation and it isn't unreasonable that he could have thought trayvon was reaching for his gun for whatever reason. In hindsight, this might not have been true but self-defense claims don't require him to have perfect knowledge of the situation."
t1_caunbp5,4,4,1,1,"&gt; What doesn't seem plausible to me, is that a man who was taking MMA classes three times a week  It sounds like he just started, although I can't find a good source for this. One headline said ""In the weeks before the shooting,"" but I can't find out exactly what they mean. Let's say that's about a month.  I don't think you can reliably escape mount after 12 mma classes against a stronger opponent in a stressful situation. I don't think you could do so after 12 classes of straight ground grappling where you had spend a fair portion of the time on obtaining/escaping mount.   &gt; What seems even less plausible to me is that Trayvon was all at once suffocating Zimmerman, slamming his head against the ground, and reaching for Zimmerman's gun while telling Zimmerman, ""you're going to die tonight.""   I'm sitting on your chest, which makes it a bit harder to breath to begin with. I grab your neck with my right hand and pound your head on the ground. I reach for your gun with my left hand. My mouth is still free for trash talking.   I doubt that he would be simultaneously choking and slamming GZ; most likely did one, then the other. If I was choking you and you moved your head forward, I could slam you back down, but you wouldn't want to do that because moving your head forward would put even more pressure on your throat.  &gt; What would compel Trayvon, a kid who had really only ever gotten in trouble for smoking weed, to decide to kill a man he didn't know?  Maybe he's done more bad stuff than that. Weed was just the only thing he got caught for.   I suspect he probably just wanted to beat up GZ, but once the gun came into play he figured ""kill or be killed."" "
t1_cauphni,1,1,1,0,"&gt; I suspect he probably just wanted to beat up GZ, but once the gun came into play he figured ""kill or be killed.""   If that's true, Zimmerman is the one who escalated the situation and Martin was the one acting in self-defense."
t1_caupmcb,5,5,5,1,"&gt; If that's true, Zimmerman is the one who escalated the situation and Martin was the one acting in self-defense.  This in itself doesn't make sense:  Someone comes into your home to rob you. He's armed only with a baseball bat. You live in a castle doctrine state, so you pull out your firearm. He runs towards you with the bat. You shoot him.   Under your legal analysis, did you escalate the situation and therefore the robber is acting in self defense? Or is his prior act (of invading your house) the cause the matter?"
t1_cauq8sg,1,1,1,0,"http://thecriminallawyer.tumblr.com/post/24691276257/15-self-defense-it-was-him-or-me  You just gave a very anomalous situation there. A baseball bat is certainly capable of killing someone, and it happened in your house, so in this case you are justified. You didn't even escalate the situation, since the baseball bat was already ""deadly force"", or at least I'd say it was.  If someone hits you with no weapon, as Zimmerman alleged Martin did, it's absolutely not justified to pull a gun on them."
t1_cauqd3a,1,1,1,0,"&gt; If someone hits you with no weapon, as Zimmerman alleged Martin did, it's absolutely not justified to pull a gun on them.  What if that person was Mike Tyson? Not being flippant here - but obvious Mike Tyson's fists qualify as deadly weapon.  Would a reasonable person, in Zimmerman's situation, believe that his life is in danger? I don't know - because the **case is not fully presented yet**. "
t1_caurhj9,1,1,1,0,"Treyvon Martin was not Mike Tyson.  To say that fists qualify as ""deadly force"" in general makes a mockery of the whole concept of ""non-deadly force"". The concept exists in law for a reason."
t1_cautyr8,1,1,1,0,"Maybe we are losing sight of something here. According to Zimmerman, Martin verbally threatened to kill him. If (and this is a big if) we believe him, then wouldn't that argue that pulling a gun is proportional?   The jury's decision will in part rest on whether they believe Zimmerman was reasonable in his beliefs. "
t1_cauukxk,1,1,1,0,"&gt; You would certainly go to jail for that. You would certainly be convicted. This is not even disputable; if you shoot someone who was merely attempting to punch you any jury in the world would convict you.  And you are *certainty* wrong. To quote Florida's Self-Defense Law FL 782.02:  &gt; The use of deadly force is justifiable when a person is resisting any attempt to murder such person **or to commit any felony upon him or her** or upon or in any dwelling house in which such person shall be.  So long as that bunch is thrown in aid of a felony committed upon him, he may draw his gun. "

t1_cauqajh,1,1,1,0,"This reasoning breaks down when you consider that Zimmerman was the person who initiated the encounter in the first place, by stalking Martin and continuing to do so against direct orders by authorities."
t1_cauqglb,1,1,1,0,"FWIW, the operator said he didn't have to follow him, not ""Stop following him"". Could go either way."
t1_cauqht4,2,2,1,0,"&gt; Zimmerman was the person who initiated the encounter in the first place  The 'initiation of encounter' itself doesn't justify anything. Martin's state of mind on being followed matters. Did he think his life was in danger? Of course, unfortunately, Martin is dead so we can't ask him. Hence, there's a real question for the Jury to decide. But just because Zimmerman 'initiated' the encounter doesn't *in itself* justify his guilt.   &gt; continuing to do so against direct orders by authorities.  The dispatcher told zimmerman that he doesn't need to follow martin. He wasn't 'directly ordered'. Furthermore, it's questionable whether dispatcher can issue authoritative commands. "
t1_caurlql,1,1,1,0,...except the fact that if he hadn't followed Martin none of this would have happened?
t1_cauuln3,1,1,1,0,"But Zimmerman was in his car when making the call, and he was not in his car when the incident happened. He had to have gotten out and followed Martin further."
t1_caut5rf,1,1,1,0,And if Martin had gone straight home or stayed at home none of this would have happened either.  None of that  really matters because none of them are acts of aggression or provocation.    What matters is who initiated the physical conflict.

t1_cavz2bt,5,5,5,1,"there is evidence, he said it himself in the video reeinactment with police. He gets to the T tells them an address and he says something like, when I was back there they said ""we don't need you to do that""about following TM, but he kept walking because he was determined to give his location, even though his truck was parked in a cul de sac right by the clubhouse, the police would have easily spotted it. TM didn't know that was what GZ was doing because GZ never tried to identify himself to the teen.   If it were me, I would have yelled in the direction I saw this kid go ""I am with the neighborhood watch, the police are on their way"" and kept my ass in the car until the real police showed up. "
t1_cauryqf,1,1,1,0,Actually this can vary significantly by state.      How it is in Ohio might not be the same as in Texas.       How it is in Californa will almost certainly not be how it is in Florida.
t1_cauqlq8,4,1,1,0,"Given that Zimmerman did study criminal justice, and had a concealed carry permit, he probably knew the justification for the use of lethal force.  It could go one of two ways, either he is using that knowledge to lie and craft a false story that justified his use of lethal force (and he would have had to come up with that story in the 30 seconds before the cops showed up), or he used that knowledge to ensure he was justified before drawing his firearm, so he is telling the truth and his story perfectly fits the justification for self defense because he made sure he was acting in accordance with the law at the time of the shooting.  We can't assume he is lying because his story perfectly meets the legal justification for the use of lethal force... that is ridiculous, it's just as likely that he was actually justified because he knows the law and didn't want to break it."

t1_cayikrk,1,1,1,0,Trayvon's motive for attacking Zimmerman was established by Jeantal:  he was afraid that he was being stalked by a rapist.
t1_cav7n9h,1,1,1,0,ok tough guy.
t1_cav6fuw,1,1,1,0,"&gt;I suggest going down to your local MMA gym and jumping in the ring with a 17 year old kid, especially if you are in your 30s or 40s and long out of shape to see for yourself. Even work your way up to it. Then imagine that you aren't in a ring and no one is there to call time or stop the fight. This is the best way to test your view and perhaps change it.  Well said.  Of all the people that claim to 'know all about fighting', a very small percentage have actually had any kind of training against a variety of body types.  Of that small percentage that actually train, a small percentage of them get to the level where they can spar with the kid gloves off.  I can count at least 3 instances in the last 3 years in my city where someone has been left dead or a vegetable as a result of getting their head smashed in while fighting. The media's response to those stories?  Too bad, so sad, not news.  "

t1_cauv5xm,1,1,1,0,"If someone big and strong is on top of you at night in a deserted area, hitting you in the face, you **are** at very real risk of death or grievous bodily injury.  At this point, even if it's a small chance you'll actually die, you're totally justified in defending yourself with whatever means are available to you.  The other option is hoping this guy attacking you, who is clearly in a superior position, is not going to kill you, and that's not a fair situation to put anyone in.  Even if Trayvon was bluffing with his threat, *even if he didn't make the threat*, legally it's unfair to expect Zimmerman to put his life in his attacker's hands in order to not use deadly force to defend himself.  When he's on the ground with someone strong punching him in the face, he has a totally reasonable fear of harm coming to his person that justifies self-defense.  Also, I don't know if you've ever been hit hard in the face, but you'd be amazed what one good shot to the face will do to your thought process.  You aren't calmly thinking ""Maybe there's some way I can de-escalate this situation so the least harm is done,"" you're thinking ""OH FUCK OH FUCK OH FUCK.""   And judging by his wounds Zimmerman was hit multiple times.  "
t1_cavjcvk,1,1,1,0,*had no injuries except for the cut on his hand and the bullet wound in his chest.
t1_cavna3e,4,4,1,1,"There is eyewitness testimony stating the exact opposite.  It's not credible.  Z's face shows ZERO evidence of multiple blows.  Knuckles do a SHITLOAD of superficial damage, and Z didn't look any worse than most dudes who get KTFO with one punch in the nose.  Meanwhile, while his face is apparently getting beat in, and with a broken nose that he probably can't breathe out of, he's continuously screaming for help?  Ever heard a person with a broken nose scream?  I haven't, mostly because they can't due to pain.  So no, none of that is clear.  You know what's more likely?  Trayvon decks him and he pulls out a gun yelling shit while Trayvon screams, then shoots him out of frustration.  That's usually how it goes in places that aren't so nice.  It blows my mind that redditors in mass are so sheltered that they can blindly defend this dude with only speculation.  This motherfucker straight up **cased** a fucking 17 year old kid and ran up on him.  That much *is* known.  I'd say put yourself in Trayvon's shoes, but that clearly wouldn't work."
t1_cavorrb,1,1,1,0,"&gt;Hahaha, you think he pulled the gun and then let Trayvon scream for help for at least 10 - 15 seconds and then shot TM because he was frustrated?!  Ever had a gun pulled on you?  That's pretty much how it goes until the coward builds up enough courage to pull the trigger.  &gt;If I'm Trayvon, I don't get fucking offended by thinking someone is following me to the point I think it's a good idea to go punch that guy in the nose.  Lol where are you from?  Must be nice to know that when people follow you, they have only honorable intentions in mind.  &gt;Only people that have had a hard upbringing think that way  **FTFY**.  &gt;Anyone that is wearing a hoodie, walking around in the rain, cutting through people's yards looks fucking suspicious.

Yes , it's an mma position.  A LOSING mma position. Trained fighters do sometimes escape mount, but if you are being ground and pounded,  you're pretty much fucked.  "
t1_cb1amc8,4,5,1,1,"Sorry, how do you know this for sure?  It was Zimmerman who admittedly followed Travon, AFTER Trayvon was running away... you mean to tell me you're fine with someone following YOU at night??? For no reason.  The police on the phone told Zimmerman ""we don't need you to do that"" pertaining to following the kid, but he still followed him.  So I'm not entirely sure if perhaps the kid was scared out of his mind, or at least threatened like you or I would, if someone, a complete stranger, followed after we ran away from the guy. And sorry, ""neighborhood watch"" man doesn't have the authority or right to tell anyone to stay put."
t1_cb1j4c4,1,1,1,0,"Fair enough, and although we disagree, that's why you and I would never be in Zimmerman's shoes now, because we have common sense.  Conversely, something not being a crime doesn't mean that it might not cause someone to fear for his life. Certainly, walking around at night in the neighborhood where you're family lives is not a crime either, but Zimmerman thought Tryavon was a threat. I'm sorry, when someone is following me at night, for no reason, I'm fearing my safety, and I will defend myself.   Zimmerman will get at least manslaughter for creating a situation that caused anyone to fear for his life, not creating a narrative, just stating how most people would feel under the circumstances. Neighborhood watch people around the country will think it's alright to initiate confrontations, then claim self defense after murdering innocent people if Zimmerman walks. "
t1_cb1jo2k,1,1,1,0,"&gt; I'm sorry, when someone is following me at night, for no reason, I'm fearing my safety, and I will defend myself.  no need to apologize.  i get where you are coming from.  you might be afraid, but you're in a floridian gated community, not east l.a.  what would you defend yourself from?  to defend yourself, there must be an act of aggression, and in this particular case, from what we know, there wasn't one on the part of the survivor.  initiating verbal contact is not an act of aggression you need to physically defend yourself from.  you seem to be suggesting the dead person was in fear for his life but it was not possible that the survivor was in fear for his.  if they were both in fear for their lives, and the dead person may well have been, idk, they both have the right to defend themselves.  and one guy came out better than the other.  "
t1_cb1kpaq,5,5,1,1,"Alright, but one was following the other, not a crime, but nonetheless an aggressive action.   I don't feel Zimmerman is a monster, I just think he was paranoid, out to get someone apprehended, which caused his judgement to lapse, and caused him to think Martin was a threat, which in turn caused  him to follow the kid after Martin actually ran away. Then, the scuffle took place, but have you seen Zimmerman's face after the ""pummeling""? No damage to his eyes, cheeks, fine a broken nose, but getting beaten to death? Nope, Zimmerman's lying about that.   Also, why should we simply believe that Zimmerman didn't START the fight? I love how people just simply assume Zimmerman's version was right, without questioning whether he shoved the teen (a violent act, but not one that would show in the autopsy).   Also, if he's getting beaten to death, he shoots a perfect shot to the chest, WITH someone on top of him waling on him with deadly punches??  As for the following, there's a conservative, a respected one who agrees with me.  Conservative intellectual George will echoed the same sentiment:  ""Mr. Zimmerman says he was acting under this self-defense law, but he is said to have been recorded saying he pursued the person. You cannot be in pursuit and acting in self-defense.” http://www.mediaite.com/tv/george-will-on-trayvon-martin-stand-your-ground-law-is-a-bad-idea/  Finally, if I'm armed, and this is just me, but I'm going to make sure that I'm a distance from a potential threat, so that I can draw the weapon. I'm not getting inches away from someone who could hurt me, or prevent me from grabbing the gun. But then again, that's me, obviously Zimmerman ""somehow"" knew, without warning the kid that he was armed, that he'd be able to both confront the potential ""perp"" in close proximity, possibly get into a fight, but also miraculously pull his gun out without a problem.  "
t1_cb3qgr4,4,1,1,0,"Let's see. Zimmerman saw a hoodie wearing black guy and got suspicious, only to have his suspicions validated by almost being beaten to death by the hoodie wearing black guy. Following the acquittal, thousands of hoodie wearing black guys take to social media and threaten to kill Zimmerman. What exactly did Zimmerman do wrong again?"
t3_228jbo,4,2,3,0,"So, I attended summer camp from ages 8-16 and got heavily involved with the camp setting, and have worked most summers in between college semesters up at the camp I grew up at in a managerial capacity.  Growing up, the emphasis was placed on silly movie cliche's (Think heavyweights, Adams family values, camp nowhere) and the kids having fun, and if you were lucky you took something greater away from it but the goal was to have a good and memorable time.   Today though from my standpoint that culture has been lost in favor of a gigantic acceptance circle jerk. Pranks are no longer allowed because mom's got lawsuit happy but more importantly it's gone because it ""may"" hurt someone's feelings. In my particular case, it's a YMCA camp and while most of the staff is not religious, nor does the camp put heavy emphasis on Christianity in the first place however anything resembling Jesus including ultimately minor campfire song lyrics ect. have been removed because we are attempting not to force people to ""believe something"" Now, I have stated I'm not a religious person, but some of these things are simply a tradition, and the camp setting as a entity is all about tradition and honoring it. Lastly from my personal observations of the newer/younger staff from afar, it's sort of a catastrophic circle jerk, and if you break the jerk you are ostracized by the staff hive mind.    I don't think this is a good thing for the camp setting. I think kids going up to camp and skinning their knees, physically or emotionally is a good personal growth experience. Camp is a prime example of how adults have to operate in the real world, because sometimes you have to make things work with people you simply don't love or even like, and ultimately there are people that you do not simply HAVE to affiliate yourself with people who you feel are a detriment to your life.   Make no mistake, I don't think there's any room for bullying however; I don't think there's any crime in the boys doing something icky to the girls cabin  vice versa (silly string, shaving cream non damaging stuff that is ultimately harmless, but makes the kids feel accomplished in mischief.)  I think an important part of the culture is lost in the modern camp setting because we're too concerned with protecting the kids instead of giving them a positive but very real exposure to somewhat real life.  Please CMV.  "
t1_cgke088,3,4,3,1,"I went to and worked at the same camp for 11 years. From my understanding (and experience), camp is almost purely a social experience. When you are young, it is a social experience where you learn how to become friends with children of your own sex without the aid of your parents. As you get older, it is a social experience befriending (and other activities...) people of the opposite sex. I don't know if this makes camp all about ""acceptance,"" but it definitely makes the camp owners want to foster a friendly environment.  In regards to pranks, at my camp they used to be condoned; however, the pranks progressed year after year, become more and more vagrant (for lack of a better word). When my camp switched owners, the first year of under new ownership, a particularly ridiculous prank occurred (I wouldn't even call it a prank; some idiots stole candy from the Canteen). It was the owner's first year so he just put out a zero tolerance policy towards pranks and the lot. People still do them, but they are much smaller and more discreet than before.   In regards to protecting kids, I think a camp should foster a safe environment, especially for younger children. By age 12, most parents are okay if their children get hurt at camp (i.e. when they would get a call from the camp, they would say it happens), but for younger children (ages 8-11) parents were very scared whenever they heard their children were hurt. This is understandable and I this is why I accept trying to make camp a safe environment. At these young ages, camp is literally all about the activities to the kids; when they are older, camp is about the friendships and relationships they make. If the focal point of camp for these younger children doesn't appear safe to a parent considering sending their child there, then the camp would be failing one of its goals.   That's at least what I think about it anyway."
t1_cgke5cw,1,1,1,0,"See, with the youngsters though they're completely uninterested in doing anything prank like in the first place. In my experience they're more concerned with farting in their bunks and falling asleep by 9PM sharp. lol. It's the 12-15 year olds who want to meet a cute girl or give the girls cabin a scare, and it's the 14-17 year olds who are purely concerned with the drama of the situation and want to meet someone instead of do activities.  I think a big problem with the setting is the advent of the ACA. I think personally that has been the biggest determent to the modern camp setting. It's brought in this idea of ""Camp that is corporate"""
t3_28o7uj,4,5,1,1,"In a recent AskReddit thread, one of my pet peeves came up - someone ""admitting"" that they had a crush in third grade, or some comparable age.  I told myself that I had ""crushes"" on several girls throughout elementary school, I acted really strangely around them, I told people that I had these crushes, the whole shebang. But then puberty hit, and as I turned out to be gay, all of these crushes I thought I had on girls ended up not being genuine. I was wrong about what a crush was then, because I was 10.  So it truly does irk me that people say that they ""had their first crush in third grade"" or when Google makes an advertisement for their new tablet involving an 11 year old wanting to ""ask out a girl"". They don't know what a crush is. They don't even know if they're interested in people of that gender, not at that age.  I would love not to feel this way, as it would save me a lot of unnecessary anger toward people who don't mean to offend me. If you feel that you had a genuine crush before puberty, I would love to hear your point of view. Thanks!  "
t1_cicu5de,5,5,1,1,"An eight year old boy says ""When I grow up, I want to be an astronaut.""  Of course, from his perspective, he genuinely means it. He's seen an astronaut in a movie, maybe, and thinks it looks cool. He has no actual understanding of what an astronaut does, or how rigid and dangerous is. He has no idea that when he turns 12 he's going to discover how much he  actually hates the boring work of astronomy and physics, and that he's not really into working out and prefers writing poetry. By the time he's an adult, being an astronaut is the LAST thing he wants to be.  But that doesn't mean it's not 'genuine' when he said it as a kid. Kids are nothing if not genuine. What it means is that he said it in the way kids say all things: uninformed, mostly emotional, imitating adult behaviors and media depictions with little real understanding. From his perspective, he really does want to be an astronaut, and from an adult perspective, we know that's cute precisely because it's such a child's understanding of the world; that's why we say ""Awww"".  Childhood crushes are the same way. Of course they're absolutely nothing like adult crushes. Of course kids have none of the vital information (like, say, their sexual preferences) that will shape their adult desires. A childhood crush is much more like ""play"", but to kids, play has all the emotional weight of real action. It's incredibly different from an adult crush, but that doesn't make it false or worse, lying to oneself."
t1_cicu6hc,5,5,1,1,"ooooooh interesting question. I felt like I had a lot of crushes when I was a kid. I did the same things--the acting strangely, the telling good friends I had a crush on x, etc etc etc. I also remember obsessing about the crush object and imagining out all sorts of weird narrative scenarios where I have to rescue them or we both realize we're in love through some improbable situation. Strangely at the time it felt a lot like a medieval courtly love, like abelard and heloise--a feeling of intense devotion and obsession, the sense that material signs of love like kissing or dates would ""ruin"" it. So in that sense I agree with you, I think. I even worked up the nerve to tell one girl I liked her in 7th grade, after spending months building up to it, and when I finally did she said ""yeah, I know"" and my mind went blank and I had literally NO IDEA what to do next. Nothing happened and we continued being normal friends.   But even now (I'm 25 now) and I can get sort of obsessive about certain girls in the same way--just idealizing them and thinking about how great they are all the time and how they complete me. It's a mode of attraction which makes for a lot of unrequited love and, also, makes me act like an ass. This happens ESPECIALLY if I wait a really long time to make a move on someone I like. The way I see it, a crush is like an investment of hope. You dump some imagination into what it would like to be with that person, and then that image feeds you a certain shining. Even though it can slow action, because the reality of what that idealized person actually IS breaks through the illusion which sustains you for so long. ANYWAYS this is all to say while you're right that children don't have any sexual component to their crushes, the fantasy and imagination to evoke romantic feelings can still work. Kids develop those kinds of feelings early on through parental behavior, through culture, etc etc etc. What do you think?"
t1_cicwthx,1,1,1,0,"You can't judge everyone else's experiences based solely off of your own. When you say that somebody **can't** experience a crush because **you** didn't, it would be as mistaken as me saying that men **can't** be attracted to other men because **I'm** not. "

t3_1fmiv1,1,2,1,0,"To go along side the WTC 9/11 post.  To date:  1) the ""magic bullet"" theory has been proven possible by multiple independent testers. Its not only possible, but recreatable.   2) Firing that amount of shots with that rifle is not only possible, but easy, especially for a trained marskman like Oswald.  3) To date, there has been 0 evidence for any other shooters. No shell casings. No recovered bullets. No pictures of a gunman. No reliable witnesses of more than one shooter. Nothing.  4) LHO killed a cop later that day. No one seems to ever bring that up. He killed him with a pistol he had ordered through the mail. Ballistics matches the gun. You don't kill a police officer on a whim.  5) ""Back and Away"" - A head is going to react like that when shot from behind (as in consistent with the lone gunman theory)  There is nothing I love more than a good conspiracy theory, but there is absolutely no evidence suggesting more than one shooter, only a shitload of suspicious/fishy shit that went down.

The distance was less than 100 yards (Marines train up to 500 meters, the 50s and the 100 targets are basically ""freebies"")  3) Out of ~180 witnesses there, 138 of them said they heard three shots (consistent of the single shooter explanation)   4) Oswald shot the cop and then ducked into the theater. Brewer (a store clerk who said he saw Oswald acting suspicious) was the one who reported him, not for not paying for the movie, but rather for acting suspicious. Given that the POTUS (And a cop) were just shot, sending 20 cops wouldn't be unheard of.  5) Actually if you shoot a large hard sphere filled with goo on the inside, the result is that the object will come back at you.   example here: http://youtu.be/iSg6XwXe6WQ?t=26m53s  And my main point is... there is 0 evidence of any other shooter.

t3_1ibg1p,4,5,1,1,"For me, the case was just a guy (who happened to be white), spotted a suspicious guy (who happened to be black). They cross paths, a misunderstanding occurs, and one ends up dead during a fight. Personally, I think Zimmerman would have done the same (ie following someone) for ANY person who looked suspicious. I also don't think the outcome of the case was racist either, since it was done in self defense, especially considering the injuries Zimmerman sustained. When all was said and done... yeah it's sad a teenager died, but I don't think there were any racial overtones at all.   CMV, please. "
t1_cb2zhvu,4,4,1,1,"&gt;But does it affect the case itself?  Only with regard to the 2nd degree murder charge, It would be necessary to show anger toward Martin, race could be used as that motivator.   &gt;Hispanic male who had been a victim of racial hatred in the past. Has black roots, an afro-peruvian great-grandfather. Run a business with a black business partner, whose family stayed at his house after a burglary. Led an inquiry regarding the beating of a black homeless male, against a mostly white Sanford police department, publicly criticizing their procedure - Which led to the resignation of the police chief.  I think Zimmerman's view of any black out of the context is largely (not completely) irrelevant.  How does he feel about young black males on the streets of his neighborhood?, that is relevant. It is easy to make exceptions, exclusive or inclusive. ""my business partner is not like those other guys"" or ""these punks on the streets are not like my business partner.""   &gt;was it a factor of how Zimmerman assessed the situation?  if the burglars are known to be black then it should have been a factor for Zimmerman otherwise he is an exceptionally poor detective.   "
t1_cb3ecr8,5,5,5,1,"&gt; The part that is in question is the ""looked suspicious."" Did trayvon being black have anything to do with him ""looking suspicious"".   If we believe Zimmerman's statements, and the police as well as a jury found no apparent reason not to, Zimmerman did not know Martin's race when he began following him. What attracted Zimmerman's attention was a man wearing a hood walking between houses at night, in a neighborhood that had been troubled by burglaries.  Lets put this another way. Is there any actual evidence to suggest that Zimmerman is a racist? This seems to be an assertion that's being made between the lines without any real support.   &gt;So my first question is do you think there is a sentiment in our culture that feels that black people look/are more suspicious?  Sadly, yes. I'd say it's conditional: an older, clean-cut black man wearing a suit? No. A young black man wearing certain kinds of fashion, sporting tattoos and gold teeth? Yes. Is that racist? I'd argue no. Is it a form of prejudice? That's arguable - clothing and manner of dress are used for a variety of reasons, but one being to signify a certain set of beliefs and values, an adherence to a certain social ""code"".   The fact is that inner city/ghetto culture in this country has rightfully earned a reputation for thuggish behavior. It isn't George Zimmerman's fault that if you open a hip-hop club in a city, even in a nice neighborhood, you have to pay for ten times more security and still deal with a higher frequency of fights and gang activity. That's just a fact, and we can either own up to it and figure out how to deal with it, or we can go off into some hippie-dippy la-la land of ignorant political correctness. It isn't a matter of skin color, it's a matter of cultural mores and values promulgated by different quarters of society. But it is an important matter that needs to be addressed: the epidemic of violence in the inner city is claiming a lot of lives, and costing a lot more their livelihoods. If we really care about our children and our countrymen, we will summon up the courage to stop looking for scapegoats and face up to this serious problem. Trayvon Martin, who by all accounts knocked a guy onto the ground and then continued beating him mercilessly, is a sad victim of this culture, as are *so many* young black men and women. Look at the homicide rates in Chicago, look at the faces of the victims. Look at the perpetrators... it's not a bunch of George Zimmermans.  I feel tremendous sympathy for the kid's family. I feel tremendous sympathy for the kid himself... he could be so many kids I grew up with, called friend, ate dinner with. We've all made mistakes, and you and I, dear reader, are still here to talk about it, able to learn from them and carry on with our lives. Sadly, Trayvon isn't still with us, and will never have that opportunity to learn from mistakes. He didn't deserve that fate.   But the reality is that George Zimmerman is not ultimately to blame for his fate... George Zimmerman had no other choice, if we take a rational reading of events. Anyone who says they would passively lay there and let themselves be pinned to the ground and beaten into unconsciousness or worse on the street is either lying or hopelessly naive, and probably both. What's to blame for Trayvon's fate is a culture that teaches our young men that they are not men unless they solve their problems with violence, that respect is synonymous with beating people up, and using your words and your head instead of your fists is cowardly, and that running away from a meaningless confrontation is a shameful act rather than a wise one. It's a fate that will continue to befall an unfortunate number of us, and disproportionately those of us who are black or poor or from the 'hood, until we steel ourselves to confronting the real problem."

Connally, and did so as an individual actor (not as the agent of a nation or organized group). My knowledge of the Kennedy Assassination is admittedly limited; I've studied it in school and participated in several university level class discussions about the investigations and conspiracies surrounding the issue. After looking at the conclusions reached by the Warren Commission, I was somewhat skeptical of the notion that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, but the HSCA report clarifies some of the issues surrounding the timing and circumstances of the assassination, and leaves open the idea that Oswald may have had a partner. Additionally, I do feel that the events following the assassination are slightly suspicious (notably LBJ appointing and overseeing the Warren Commission), but are not at present sufficient for me to discount the accepted explanation of the assassination.  The number of conspiracy or alternate theories surrounding the assassination is prodigious and confusing, to say the least, but I am willing to accept an alternate theory and CMV if someone can present a compelling alternate explanation of the JFK assassination supported by clear and provable facts."

I've also heard a second hand account of a conversation a friend of mine had with the marksman instructor who trained Oswald in the military. He testifies Oswald was a good enough shot.  - We'll likely never know if Oswald was hired, but I believe he was hired by a friend of Communism, either a government (Russia, Cuba) or group (Communist Party members), most likely Russia. Kennedy was a threat because I believe Russia feared him escalating the Cold War into an actual war, and despite their hard attitude, they didn't want a nuclear war either.  - I believe the Mafia thought they would be blamed, as they weren't too fond of Kennedy, and so they were happy to help out when asked to kill Oswald in revenge. They never knew, but the same people who hired LHO hired them. They chose Ruby because, he loved America, and he was terminal. He didn't have long anyway, so he was a low risk to talk. Once Ruby dies in prison, all loose ends are tied.  - No one within the American government was involved. It was not an inside job.  Again, I draw these conclusions based on what I've read.

t1_cbujuoi,4,4,1,1,"Sorry for the delay in responding; life and such. Okay, you’re starting to convince me that there was more at play than I initially suspected, but I have a few more questions that you might be able to clear up.  * You’ve convinced me that Oswald acted alone, or at least plausibly could have made the shots that killed Kennedy and wounded Gov. Connally. Re-examining the distance Oswald was shooting from and the fact that he did actually miss twice, it fits that someone with his marksmanship skills would’ve done poorly but still hit his target.  * I’m still skeptical about why a communist group would want to kill JFK. You’re right to point out that post-assassination most of the American public was more concerned with the effect the attack had on domestic affairs and the personal lives of the First Lady, etc. Yet that ignores the fact that LBJ immediately succeeding Kennedy led to increases in tensions with the USSR both in the short term and more over in the long term. I still don’t see why communist groups would want to kill Kennedy in Dallas; why didn’t they kill him around the Bay of Pigs or the Cuban Missile Crisis? I also feel like you brush off them trusting Oswald; if he was actually hired and then apprehended, he would have still had plenty of time to tell one of the Dallas police officers or FBI agents who interrogated him for several hours at least some degree of information about who had hired him. Sure, the FBI might have thought he was a nut, but in the immediate aftermath of a presidential assassination, I seriously doubt that they wouldn’t have followed up on every piece of information he provided, regardless of how crazy it sounded (and communists hiring an assassin in the political climate of the early 60’s isn’t that crazy). Sure, Oswald *didn’t* rat on the people who hired him (aside from saying he was a “patsy”) but the odds that he *might* have still seem to me to preclude a communist group from hiring such a lose cannon (who, again, defected *away* from the USSR despite initially professing his love for the Soviets).  * If you can convince me on the Russia/Communist angle, I’m starting to buy the next link in the chain, of Mafia involvement. That said, I don’t see the evidence in your argument for Mafia involvement. Sure, they *could* have, and I see their motivations, but what is your actual proof for Mafia involvement? "

t1_c8t6pyq,1,1,1,0,"I think there is a lot of truth in what you say, but I think the key factor with world renowned people is that they *take advantage of* their luck where others do not. There are lots of people that come across good opportunities, but many of them are either unprepared for them or do not pounce on them when they appear so the luck is squandered.  The extremely successful position themselves to take advantage of every lucky break that comes along.  So this isn't exactly a refutation of exactly what you said. But perhaps it might change how you view luck in a more general way. A lot of times the more successful didn't have more luck than others, but they were able to better take advantage of the luck they had."

As an active rock climber and runner, I'd find replacing my contacts (which I hate) convenient, but have my skepticisms.  I've been hesitant to indulge because most LASEK surgeries will cost $2500/eye, according multiple evaluations at 4 different laser surgery centers. My insurance will only pay for 15% (pre-tax $). I'm saving up to go to MBA in about 4 years, and am not sure getting LASEK now would be a wise investment.  I'm also hesitant because I've heard anecdotes from friends who've had LASEK (not LASIK) that, about 2 months~1 year after their surgery, they went from an average 1.0/1.0 back down to about 0.2/0.3 ish. Still pretty damn good, but makes me suspicious about the quality of the treatment.  I've heard that people experience dry eyes constantly, and am afraid that it may imply bigger problems when I get old.  Lastly, I heard LASEK (not LASIK) hurts like a mother the first day or two.

t1_coinwc1,1,1,1,0,"Medically speaking, the doctor has said go for it. Just worried that some doctors might be underselling the point about the declining vision, but other responses on this thread say otherwise– of course taking with a grain of salt"
t1_coj0szh,4,5,2,1,"I would like to second ALMOST everything he said. Lasik was one of the best decision I ever made. Before getting lasik I dealt with glasses and contacts for years. This meant losing/breaking glasses, spending time in the morning putting contacts in and out, worry about contacts before going to into a pool, etc. The cost of lasik well justifies getting rid of those hassles not to mention that the actual monetary savings.   I remember for the first few weeks after lasik I would be just so thankful to wake up each morning having crystal clear vision. Its now become normal to me but even several years later it will pop into my head and I would think about how awesome lasik is. Cannot recommend it enough.  The one part of my experience that differed from the commenter above is that I never experienced dry eyes. Actually I differed a little from your post in that I really didn't have any pain either. Maybe lucky? I also paid significantly less than you stated (about half) but that was in part because I was referred to doctor by my sister. If you happen to live in Southern California I recommend the doctor. "

t1_coinuey,1,1,1,0,"$100 every 2~3 years on glasses. $500/yr. (a bit less thanks to insurance) on contacts. Financially I can justify it if I can finance it, but not sure if that's a thing."
t1_coixxlu,4,5,1,1,"I had LASIK done six months ago. My eyes were slightly better than yours (about -7.25). The cost for me was about $4,000 after insurance. Then I used a lot of money from my HSA. I also financed the rest.   The surgery was completely painless, but the week after that felt like I had a torn contact. It hurt, yes, but was very uncomfortable. That lasted about two weeks. Several times I had to pull over while driving to work because my eyes hurt so bad, but I'm photosensitive so the surgery isn't solely to blame.   Since then my eyes have felt great. They were very good after surgery, but one eye has slightly diminished. The eye doctor told me that this will be a good thing in the next fifteen or twenty years and will prevent me from needing reading glasses. In the meantime I do not need contacts or glasses.   I cycle and rock climb (and run, swim, weight lift, etc., etc.). Most things I enjoyed were impossible in glasses and as I got older it was harder to wear contacts. If you can afford the surgery I would recommend it. The younger you are the better investment it is. "

I was at a show while recovering from back surgery (I was far enough recovered that I wasn't at serious risk from someone lightly bumping into me, but I didn't want to be in the middle of an aggressive pit for obvious reasons). I was standing to the outside of the crowd purposefully to avoid being in the pit, and was pushed into a pit by the people around me. I ended up fucking up my back and having issues walking for about a week afterwards. I did not volunteer to be in that pit, I did not stand too close to it for it to be my fault. Not everybody who finds themselves in a pit wants to be there. As well, when some asshole cold clocks you in the face (which happened to me in another pit) it stands to reason that you're going to be pissed. And I would imagine the majority of people you see whining or complaining fall into one of those two categories - over aggressive assholes pushing you into a pit, or over aggressive assholes hurting you on purpose in said pit.  And to clarify, I have been in many pits willingly, and have enjoyed the majority of those occasions. But those are two where I was hurt, and I was pissed off about it."

t1_cau88hc,1,1,1,0,"Can you answer something?  What justification did the police have to take the man into custody?  What statute did he violate?  Because if they were just pissed off that he was filming and taunting them, then clearly they created the situation in which they had to kill the dog, much the same as George Zimmerman created the situation in which he ""had"" to kill Trayvon Martin.  But I'm open to another interpretation."
t1_cau8ovv,1,1,1,0,"/u/looksgoodgirl's point was that OP fully understands that the police officers created the situation in which they had to kill the dog, and that they should be held accountable for that. "
t1_cau9jjt,1,1,1,0,"What other options were available once the dog started attacking?  And when did I say we should ignore the bad legislation and bad police work?  I'm going to keep asking until you answer, and I'm *definitely* going to stop explaining that I believe bad police work and bad legislation should be punished, but killing a dog that's *actively trying to kill you is not bad*. I made that VERY clear in the OP and several times in the comments that I believe that the dog's death is way overblown, but the bad police work and legislation and animal torture are way underblown.   People aren't looking at this and saying ""we need to reflect on the role of police in society and review the legislation that indirectly started this."" They're saying ""DOG DIED = BAD THING,"" and no one gives half a shit about the bad legislation. It seems like you also believe we should focus on the legislation and the bad police work. So I don't see where the disagreement is.  OK, *now* I'm gonna stop explaining that repeatedly.  "
t1_cau8emg,1,1,1,0,"All I can think of is that maybe the people sitting on the sidewalk that the police had already arrested were minors, in which case, the filming/photographing of them would be frowned upon, and the release of said photos to the press would be illegal. That, or he was making homicidal threats, but I seriously doubt that.  My best guess is that the cops were just worried he would interfere with their operation, and figured the easiest thing to do would be to lock him in a car rather than have to watch him. "
t1_cau9bgr,2,4,1,0,"Well, if you watch the video, the dog already started attacking at 3:22, jumping at the officer. It even looks like its paws may have made contact with the guy, but it's hard to tell from this angle and quality. But it was definitely starting to attack.  Unless you have good reason to believe it wasn't attacking. Hit me. After all this is CMV.   Also, regarding tasers, if it was a human adult taser, that may have likely killed the dog as well. I'm admittedly limited in knowledge on tasers and their use in law enforcement, but if TASER Int'l themselves can no longer legally advertise their products as ""non-lethal,"" then I'd hesitate to say they should have gone that route. I'm pretty sure that animal control is equipped with tasers of smaller voltages for smaller animals. But again, I suck at tasers, so if anyone wants to correct me then I'm up for it.  Also yeah the arrest was unwarranted and legislation to prevent recording of the police is stupid. That's not the issue at hand though. It *should* be the issue at hand, but everyone's all up in arms over the fact that the dog died, not over bad legislation or bad police work. Everyone's mad at the wrong shit. They're calling the police department, not the state Congress."
t1_cauamra,1,1,1,0,I'm currently being downvoted in another thread for suggesting Zimmerman escalated the situation.  Good answer.
t1_cau9452,1,1,1,0,"My dog is 140 pounds. He could easily intimidate you, as he is a Rottweiler/lab. But guess what? When he jumps up? Its to lick your face.   You dont know what that dog could do. It could be violent, it could be a kisser. Just because its a big dog doesnt mean it has more of a right to die for its actions. Should i, as a 240 pound male, be judged to be more violent than a 100 pound woman just from appearance? Just looking at us you would say i am more of a threat, but if after 3 minutes conversation you realize she is a serial killer and i am a teddy bear you will feel ridiculous for your earlier assumption. It is fine to make this assumption, it is not fine to act on it without information. If you saw me and said woman in a fight you would immediately target me, not realizing she is the dangerous one. It is a cops job to not fuck up like this."
t1_cauatj3,1,1,1,0,"When the dog that got shot jumped, it snapped at the air where the cop's arm had just been. Watch the video frame by frame or slowed down. You can see its bared teeth.  I've grown up with large dogs. German Shepherds, to be precise. This dog's demeanor was not friendly. It was not obviously aggressive, as some dogs are, but it could easily have been the unsettling quiet aggression that goes from 0 to 60 in a heartbeat. I'd have to be in the officer's shoes to know for sure."
t1_cau955t,1,1,1,0,"When arresting the man, they should have ensured that the dog was secure in the car.  If the are going to take away the man's ability to secure his dog, they should secure the dog the themselves.  Putting aside the legitimacy of the arrest, the cops created the situation by not making sure the dog was secure and then took the most heavy handed approach out of it."
t1_cau9nhu,1,1,1,0,"Their reaction was extremely heavy handed. They could have let the guy calm his dog down, despite the fact he was in cuffs. The dog was showing only very mild annoyance, and this was because the cops were threatening his owner.   If we look at the situation from the time the dog jumps out the window of the car, I still think the cops have done poorly here.  If the dog did not approach the cops, what were they going to do? Just let it wander the neighbourhood?   Once the dog was loose, they should have helped the guy sort his dog out, and then taken him away. The guy was giving no resistance.  But no, the dog was shot instead. In a residential neighbourhood. Where the situation was already very calm. "

t1_cauhm6v,1,1,1,0,"However the thief in your scenario made a conscious decision to break into a home. An animal only reacts on instinct with no thought at all so this analogy doesn't hold true. Should a big dog attack you, there are very few things you can do to stop it without getting injured yourself."
t1_cauxek7,5,5,1,1,"I don't understand the point you're trying to make here. Like the thief, the cops *did* make a conscious decision to arrest this man, and they did so uncautiously, which led to the death of a dog who otherwise would not be dead. The cops *created* a scenario where a dog died. Likewise, the thief created a scenario where the homeowner died. In both cases, no death was intended, but it happened because the cops/thief recklessly created a dangerous situation.  By the way, if someone has a gun pointed at you, you have to react quickly; they can kill you in under a second. Real life is not like movies; you don't have showdowns where two people point guns at each other, unless both of those people are idiots. The *first* person to shoot will kill the other *and* avoid being shot themselves, so there is no reason to wait unless you want to die.  The homeowner would be a nut to not shoot the thief as soon as he sees he has a gun, and the thief would be a nut to not shoot the homeowner as soon as he sees he has a gun. Like in the case of a dog attack, there are few things either of them could do to stop the other without getting killed or seriously injured."
t1_cauhuox,5,5,4,1,"If you watch the video the officer doesn't shoot the dog in self defense.  Twice he reaches for the dogs leash and the dog tries to bite or lunge at him.  Shortly after the second time, when the dog is just standing there, he shoots it.  You can see that the dog is standing on the sidewalk at least 5 or 6 feet away from the officer when he fires.  I'd understand if he shot it while the dog was in the act of trying to bite him but he clearly wasn't.  The dog was only threatening the officer when the officer threatened him.  But despite the threat not being imminent he shot the dog because he's incompetent.    After he realized it was a bad idea to try and grab the dog's leash, he should have stopped to think for a second and figured something better out.  The best solution would have been to uncuff the owner for a little second to secure the dog.  The owner wasn't violent and not a threat to the police, you can see he immediately complied when they asked to cuff him.    Even if they aren't going to uncuff a suspect, all cops have at least one form of non-lethal force.  Either a taser or pepper spray.  They also have training into when it's appropriate to use non-lethal vs lethal force.  Either one of these would have worked fantastically at taking down a dog, but the officer came over gun-drawn to deal with it.  Why did he need his gun out?  Why didn't he have his taser out instead?  Was there some situation where he thought he would need a gun going on there?  Clearly he made a major mistake in deciding what type of force to use.  "
t1_caunrrz,3,4,3,1,"Well all the other people filming were a safe distance and relatively quiet. This guy had parked his car next to the cops, was blasting music and pacing back and forth in front of them with a very large dog. Not illegal, but they weren't arresting him. It's not an arrest unless they read you your rights, they were rightfully detaining him for obstructing police work.   Now before everyone gets all ""How is video taping and being loud obstructing"" or ""He was completely in his rights"" blah blah blah. Think about this. How well would you do your job with this guy outside your cubicle, pacing back and forth with a big dog, videotaping you and blasting music? Also, of that guy were doing that outside your house, just pacing back and forth on your lawn, you could justifiably call the police to remove him. Finally, if you'll notice there were over a dozen police cars there and an Armored Vehicle, not to mention the police that were carrying assault rifles. Perhaps he shouldn't have gone up to them and shouted in their faces, because quite frankly, that's not what smart people do.  So, stop blaming the cops and instead blame this bad dog owner that got his dog shot by provoking the police."
t1_caupvos,5,1,2,0,"well you got me, I'm not black.

t3_2eyfoa,5,5,2,1,"SPOILERS FOR ANYONE WHO HASN'T PLAYED EPISODES 4 AND 5 of THE WALKING DEAD GAME SEASON 2. SERIOUSLY DON'T READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED IT.  ---    So, to those of you who played the latest episodes, you know who Arvo is. He's the Russian kid whose group you get into a shootout with. Clementine ends up shooting his reanimated sister, much to his horror. He's then led around by an abusive Kenny who beats him *twice*. The first time in the woods was completely unnecessary, and the second time was too (he didn't lie about the food or the house - and Luke's death was gonna happen anyways).    By that point in the game, *everyone* was afraid of Kenny. He was clearly teetering on the edge of sanity, and Jane even mentions how Clementine may be the only one who can bring him back before he totally loses it.    So when he shoots Clementine, *everybody lost their shit.* IIRC he was voted the most hated character this season, even moreso than Carver. [There's even a whole sub dedicated to his hate now.](http://www.reddit.com/r/fuckarvo) A lot of it is just circlejerking, but reading the discussion of these latest episodes on the net shows that a lot of people really did hate the kid for it.    But I think they're missing something really important...something Telltale Games seemed to spent a really long time trying to hammer into our heads.    After Clementine was shot and started dreaming about the RV ride with Lee, Clementine asks Lee ""why Lilly shot Carley (or Doug, depending on your playthrough)"" and Lee mentions how Lilly ""was sad."" ""That can make people angry sometimes.""    One of the responses is ""have you ever been that angry?"" To which Lee responds ""one time."" Presumably he's referring to when he murdered a state senator for sleeping with his wife, which was undoubtedly a crime of passion. Lee even mentions how people's actions might not make sense, ""because bad things happen to everybody.""    So I think with all the bad things that happened to Arvo, him shooting Clementine doesn't warrant all the hate he's getting. We all love Lee even though he did something just as bad; we can't judge Arvo for what little we've seen of him especially in his state.    **tl;dr: convince me to join the ""Fuck Arvo"" train**  "
t1_ck4715t,1,1,1,0,"&gt;In the context of a zombie apocalypse, that doesn't seem that bad. Plus Jane almost killed him and threatened to rob him (and did if you let her).  In the context of the zombie apocalypse, ambushing and attempted murder aren't bad, but punching someone is?  &gt;I think that's only true because of how Kenny acted.   The problem was they took the Arvo ambush plot and tied it in to the ""Kenny is dangerously unstable"" plot when one does not organically lead into the other. Kenny's actions towards Arvo after the attempted murder were not unstable but perfectly reasonable.  &gt;What's wrong with the way he was written? He was given undue sympathy and trust from the group despite having no reason to be endeared to them?"

Plus the way the other Russians were treating him made it clear like he wasn't in charge or anything.   Arvo implies their base was in that old half-finished house, hence them having supplies there. That was many a day's walk from where the group runs into the Russians. Arvo came to get Clem's group, they didn't stumble onto him.  &gt;How so? You could say the same about Carver. Carver was a dick who had to be dealt with, but Kenny took it way too far.  Carver needed to be killed, and his brain had to be destroyed to ensure he wouldn't rise again as a walker.

t1_ck46us6,5,4,1,1,"I think the root of the frustration and hate people feel towards Arvo is the lack of choice the game gives you. From the perspective of the characters, Arvo is a known liar, clearly hostile, has tried to escape, and has tried to have your group killed. It just doesn't make sense that so many of the characters go out of their way to help him.   Nevertheless, despite all the actions Arvo has taken against the group, they still try to help him. Arvo responds by shooting Clem. Now I think it's important to note that depending on your choices, at the time Clem was shot she would have been completely innocent.  Taking my play through as an example:  * Clem didn't steal from him * Clem didn't attack him * Clem had put her gun down when she was shot.  Arvo shot a little unarmed girl just because he was sad? Doesn't cut it for me.  &gt;  Lee mentions how Lilly ""was sad."" ""That can make people angry sometimes.""  First off, I don't think we can overlook the fact that Lee was talking to an 8 year old. It seemed very obvious to me that he was sugar coating it a bit.  Regardless, that isn't an excuse, and there are plenty of examples out there that show Arvo was a relatively bad person.   Christa had more of a reason to blame Clem for Omid's death than Arvo had a reason to blame Clem for anything. She didn't take it out on her, or shoot her, she attempted to move and even took care of Clem.  &gt; We all love Lee even though he did something just as bad; we can't judge Arvo for what little we've seen of him especially in his state.  It is implied that Lee's crime involved people really close to him, which led to a sense of betrayal and overreaction. It's definitely bad, but not the same as Arvo.  What I think you are forgetting is that Arvo was a terrible person BEFORE all the bad stuff happened to him, and that he took out his anger on an innocent bystander.  The entire catalyst to his shitty situation was him putting Clem's group in mortal danger based on a lie.  I'd even go one step further and say Kenny was right. It seemed really obvious that Arvo was going to try and kill someone. Had the group just been reasonable and listened to Kenny to begin with, then all the deaths in E5 could have been avoided. "
t1_ck47ebr,4,4,1,1,"∆ okay, that part about the lack of choices towards Arvo makes sense. MisanthropeX touched on that, but you did a better job explaining why Arvo's actions towards you don't make as much sense depending on Clem's actions (poor storytelling on Telltale's part?).    But I'm still not convinced he's a terrible person.    &gt;Arvo shot a little unarmed girl just because he was sad? Doesn't cut it for me.    Not ""sad"", more ""angry."" Kind of like Lilly.    &gt;Christa had more of a reason to blame Clem for Omid's death than Arvo had a reason to blame Clem for anything. She didn't take it out on her, or shoot her, she attempted to move and even took care of Clem.    Christa also had history with Clem, so she knows that Clem didn't intend for Omid to die.    &gt;It is implied that Lee's crime involved people really close to him, which led to a sense of betrayal and overreaction. It's definitely bad, but not the same as Arvo.    But in Arvo's case, strangers (who almost robbed and killed him), killed his entire group and beat him up several times. He didn't hate Mike or Bonnie; only Kenny (for obvious reasons) and Clementine (who killed his sister, and though even as you mentioned she didn't necessarily do anything wrong towards him afterwards, you never really got to make up with him like others did - thanks Telltale!).    &gt;What I think you are forgetting is that Arvo was a terrible person BEFORE all the bad stuff happened to him    He did unto you what you basically did to him.     &gt;Had the group just been reasonable and listened to Kenny to begin with    Really? I think everyone was reasonable to fear Kenny by that point. Except leaving the house with all your supplies was a dick move, but not trusting Kenny anymore wasn't wrong. Only Clementine (and the player) knows that Kenny wasn't all that bad. "
t1_ck4kq73,1,1,1,0,"This is exactly it, don't get me wrong I enjoyed the two series but the game gives you nothing but the illusion of choice, everything all gets wrapped up the same way and you have to go through these set plot events that don't really make sense depending on which choices you made just so there's no real branching paths in a game supposedly about storytelling and the like."
t1_ck4jqhn,5,5,1,1,"If anyone deserves the hatred, it's Bonnie. She rips into Clem after the drowning and says something snide (at least in one option, I'm not sure about both) that ""it must be nice to be a pretty girl and not have to do anything"".  Bitch, are you high? Ever since you met Clem she's done all the work. Breaking you out of Carver's grasp, for one. What the hell did *Bonnie* offer?  So what does Bonnie do? Betray Clem and co at the earliest opportunity. And when their escape plan goes awry and Clem is shot, Mike doesn't know what to do, and Bonnie persuades him to bail. You know, Clem's bleeding out right there, but fuck it, Bonnie wants to leave.  Arvo didn't owe the group anything, and they beat him, killed his sister and his friends, maybe mugged him.

t1_chk6r9i,5,5,5,1,"Korra had many disadvantages too. I don't agree that age and experience gave Korra a significant advantage because Aang traveled around the world and had more ""real life"" experience. Korra was confined to the Southern Water Tribe and had her teachers shipped to her while she didn't know very much about the outside world. Aang was fairly spiritual and able to easily get into the Spirit World while it took Korra most of the first two books to get to that point.   I don't discount the struggle, but Aang certainly made things worse for himself. He would have had an easier time had he not gone into stasis. Assuming that he would be able to fend off the attackers at the Air Temples, the Water Tribes and the Earth Kingdom were not withered by the Hundred Year War. The Fire Nation had nowhere near the foothold on a global scale as they had a hundred years later so it would be easier for Aang to bid his time and train. Compare the ""final showdowns"": the very elderly Sozin with no combat skills other than bending and his successor who was just a baby, versus Ozai in his prime and his prodigy heiress who was literally one of the best benders in the world. There would also be a larger number of firebenders more sympathetic to the Avatar willing to teach him; he has friends in the Fire Nation. Basically, his potential allies would have been stronger before his stasis than after.   I strongly disagree that his gang was ineffective. Team Avatar 1 literally taught Aang the other elements. Katara taught Aang after she surpassed his skill in the NWT and Pakku had nothing else to teach her, Toph taught him earthbending, Zuko mentored him in firebending. I can hardly call them ineffective when they taught Aang. Meanwhile, comic relief Bolin and angst Mako....yuck. They couldn't even hold off Desna and Eska at the spirit portals.   Lastly, I argue that Aang soldiered on because he felt that he had no other choice, but not because he truly wanted to.  "
t1_chk6s8c,4,3,1,1,"I'm not sure that I would say one is definitively better than the other, but four years at that age makes a huge difference.  While you acknowledge the age gap and Aang's age at the time, I don't think you give him the leeway that he probably deserves.    If we look at a 12 year old versus a 16 year old in our (or at least an American context), it's night and day.  While the 12 year old is struggling through the early stages of puberty, trying to find their way in 7th/8th grade, and beginning to learn about teenage life, the 16 year old is already living it.  While a person isn't necessarily super mature at 16, they are certainly going to be more mature than any 12 year old on average.  Here's a kid who is born in desperate times, and expected to save the world.  That's pretty heavy if you're an adult, much less a 12 year old child.  I look back to what I was doing when I was 12 and I can tell you I wouldn't be ready to digest the notion of saving the world in a literal sense.    &gt;Even in book 3 after a ton of ""character development"" (which Korra is not at yet), he tries to put off his inevitable showdown with Ozai.  This is because he does not want to kill, nor does he think he is capable of doing so.  I mean, he's scared too, but he doesn't know if he can beat Ozai much less kill him if he did win the fight.  Again, 12 year old.  Asking a 12 year old to perform the coup de grace is pretty gnarly.  It felt a little deus ex machina-like when the lion turtle gave him an alternate solution, but I had no trouble believing a young kid would be pretty freaked out by the implication that he had to kill someone.  In reality, Aang's whining is actually a pretty accurate portrayal of what an actual 12 year old acts like.  He has bursts of brilliance and is indeed more mature than most real 12 year olds, but his character was written extremely well.  Air nomads don't like to be held to one spot -- and by extension, I'd assume they wouldn't like to be held down by destiny.  Couple his background with his age, and you have a pretty darn good 12 year old character.  Is he ""better"" than Korra? I'm not sure anyone can really settle that (not right now anyway).  However, I do think you're being a bit too harsh on Aang."
t1_chk7ilh,1,1,1,0,"&gt;I know that I made worse and more selfish choices at 16 than I did at 12 despite having greater agency.  But that's precisely the point.  The difference in age of someone, say, 45 versus someone who is 49 is not going to be as vast as the difference between someone 12 and 16.  Both are 4 year age gaps, but the contrast is much sharper for the lower age pair.  Most people wouldn't bat an eye at, say, the 45 year old and the 49 year old getting into a relationship, but a 12 and a 16 year old in a relationship would be considered odd/wrong/etc.  Why?  Because a dearth in years means a lot more at that age.  It's not to say a 16 is fully mature, or isn't changing, or has nothing left to learn.  Far from it.  It just that it's even more amplified for someone even younger.  The average 16 year old would be much more mentally equipped to handle the stress and pressure of having to save the world than a 12 year old.    &gt;they do not possess the same mentality that typical children do, due to having to ""grow up"" and adapt quickly.   Sure -- to a point.  If, say, one of your parents pass away when you are 12, it can certainly cause you to ""grow up"" faster, but it doesn't mean you're suddenly as mature as an adult.  Indeed, kids growing up in a wartime situation are probably going to be a bit more mature than similarly aged peace time kids, but they aren't adults by any stretch of the imagination.   At the same time, kids say some poignant things from time to time, and if a kid was raised by monks I'm sure their outlook would be heavily influenced by that.  Further, he is the reincarnation of the avatar.  He has no shortage of experience to draw from, and I don't think it always has to be in some dramatic fashion when he does so.    Basically, I don't really see any major plot holes/issues by having kids that understand the urgency of an important mission but still fall prey to the inexperience of their years.  I mean, like, watch a TED talk of some 14 year old trying to do something crazy/cool like provide cheap/clean water for people in Africa.  On one hand they certainly understand the gravitas of the water situation, want to help out, etc.  On the other hand, watching them present their findings/research/product clearly shows that at the end of the day they are still a young (or relatively young) child.  I don't see cognitive dissonance when I watch TLA because I know that kids *can* be simultaneously mature and immature.    &gt;Toph didn't share this view  I disagree.  Toph was very clearly demonstrated as having a rough and tumble demeanor, and yet was still sensitive and kind underneath.  Kids show writing aside, I don't believe Toph would be capable of killing someone in cold blood -- not at the age of 12 anyway.    I like Korra and the series, but I think TLA was better written.  If I had to take a stab at explaining why I think that, its that I felt TLA was more free to explore the world of Avatar, while LOK is confined to certain parameters set forth by TLA.  To me it's like the same reason fan fiction is never really as good as the original.  It doesn't mean none of it is enjoyable, but they are writing essentially a derivative work that has to fit in the confines of the existing world.  I'm sure they can certainly take some liberties, but the pioneering is largely done.    For a more explicit example, take Harry Potter.  I'm guessing there's a good chance you've read them.  But in any event, while subsequent works can certainly be enjoyable and fun to read, any author (including Rowling herself) is bound by the original rules of the original series.  Any written work in that universe cannot (figuratively) be allowed to negate or trivialize previous struggles by inventing new stuff.  That is, if some later work introduced a new spell that would have trivialized Harry's struggles in the original 7 books, that's going to be *really* bad writing.  The same applies to LOK in my mind.  Not that it's written poorly, but now that TLA is canon, the writers have to be careful not to override anything (at least not without significant explanation/retconning).  "
t1_chkg1f1,1,1,1,0,"&amp;#8710;  I am new here, can I give more than one delta in a thread?  Largely because I don't have anything to say in rebuttal and you pretty much covered all the bases. The most compelling part of your argument is that 12 year olds can still say wise things, but you still cannot expect them to have the same moral agency as an adult even if they do act more mature than their age and participate in war. It's why juveniles and adults are not tried in the same courts in the real world. There are a few things here and there I don't agree with but they do not affect the integrity of your argument. I still have a personal preference for Korra the Avatar though :)  No, never really got into Harry Potter, I've only read the first and part of the fifth book and watched the first and fourth movies."
t1_chk8gs0,1,1,1,0,"It has better animation but has much worse writing. The stupid love triangle is only half the problem. It had a lot of potential, unfortunately it was wasted. I couldn't even finish it."
t1_chke0un,1,1,1,0,"Literally first sentence is that the shows aren't being compared, just the characters :|"
t1_chk8ser,4,1,1,0,"One of the big things that you are discounting is that Korra has had the support of family and friends for her entire upbringing.  she had actually teachers for every element who were wise experts themselves.  She had leadership and guidance through her entire upbringing and there was zero conflict for her whole upbringing.   Aang totally missed that element of childhood.  He is expected to be the Avatar with no training, no guidance, no nothing as a child.    If the nature argument doesnt sway you (age), i think the nurture argument should.  He didnt have really any of the resources Korra had growing up. "
t1_chkfbo3,5,4,4,1,"I don't agree there was zero conflict. She felt the White Lotus was confining her. All of the previous Avatars got to travel the world while she gets stuck in a compound where her life is scripted. She didn't have any friends her age until she got to Republic City whereas Aang references Kuzon, Bumi, and the other Air Nomad children. Aang wasn't confined or ostracized from his friends until he was told he was the Avatar. He doesn't know his parents as that is Air Nomad custom, but otherwise it seemed he had more of a childhood than Korra did, who was confined to her compound for training.   The scenarios are different. Aang was told he was the Avatar pretty late and he had not yet been trained. In fact, being taken away from Gyatso for Avatar training was literally the reason for running away. He didn't give it a chance.   I made another comment below - Aang refused the resources given to him until he was put in dire circumstances. It's different than not having had those resources at all. "
t1_chkxjvq,4,4,1,1,"He had a childhood, yes, but not the kind of guidance that the Avatar needs.  The Avatar is never going to have a normal childhood.  Unless he is not known to be the Avatar until later on (like aang was).    Aang left because he was upset.  but he was just going out for a ride, I is not as if his intention was to incase himself in ice for a century.    When you are 12, and someone says that you are all of a sudden super important, and you cant be with your friends or your only father figure, that is going to be pretty tramatizing.  It was his intention to leave and cool down.  But even in the first book we see aang regreting his actions.  He did not intend to be gone long, just to cool off.    He didnt have the resources until he made them available to himself.  He didnt have any teachers or guidance, and the world was literally against him.  He had to seek out and find earth benders and fire benders to teach him.  not an easy thing to do when the fire nation wants you dead.    Korra had that support system.  I understand that she didnt have an ideal childhood.  But if you think that being in what was basically a boarding school where you learn to use super powers is the same as being hunted by an entire nation of people, you are very wrong.    Aang and Korra are also very differnt people.  Raised differently and with different mindsets and approaches to life.  I dont think one or the other is better.  I think they have different strengths and weaknesses.  I dont think Korra would have been capable of simply stopping Ozai.  And i dont think she would have been capable of learning from Zuko either.  But, i think she would have been able to learn from aang's first firebending teacher, even without mastery of earth.    So, they are different.  But i dont think korra is better.  that isnt to say that she is worse, i just think that they are different.   Some of Korra's character is wrapped around young adult love and ""who is going to take me to prom"" style stuff, but i dont think that is really who she is. so i am not really thinking about that. "
t1_chkbwxl,5,4,1,0,"You're comparing apples to oranges here.  Aang's story arc was acceptance of his role as the avatar.  Remember he only found out he was the Avatar a few days before he fled.  He was 12, and he was faced with this overwhelming burden of fighting a war. The series ends with him being a fully realized Avatar at the age of 12/13 and fully accepting his duties because he found a way to harmonize his beliefs with his duties.    Korra's character arc is completely different.  She's already done that. She realized she was the Avatar at the age of 4.  She was raised in peace time and security.   Also, lets look at what being the avatar meant to both Korra and Aang.  For Aang it meant losing all of his friends, losing his teacher, dedicating himself to years more training when he thought he only had to master one element, and fight a looming war with the dangerous fire nation. For Korra, it meant she was instantly elevated to the level of a celebrity. He family (which was already royalty from the Northern Water Tribe) gained even more prestige. She was given the finest teachers, and basically lived in luxury from birth to the beginning of the series.  Throw on the differences in age and training and I think it's really unfair to compare the two.  "
t1_cl696s0,1,1,1,0,"I don't think I'd agree with the refreshingly honest thing, and I didn't really find him ""angsty"" as much as I found him to be an obnoxious, insane, moron. I mean, I suppose him being kinda stupid while thinking he's super smart could have been part of the whole ""teenager"" thing, since that's sort of a common way adults view teens, but the thing is, I was about his age when I read the book, and even I thought he was a moron. Seriously, who the hell doesn't know that ducks migrate? I knew that when I was in elementary school. Goddamn, that character pissed me off so much."

t1_cl6a7as,2,2,1,0,"&gt; when you read the book, was it with the expectation that Salinger expected you to like Holden?  You know, my English teacher asked me something similar to that when I expressed my disdain for the character. It wasn't really just that I disliked him as a person, I disliked him as a *character.* He didn't seem smartly written to me, he just seemed like an annoying character. He wasn't believably annoying, he wasn't interestingly annoying, he was just annoying. He wasn't a ""flawed character"" because he barely even qualified as a character to me. Characters, to me, either need to have some sort of redeeming quality to them or otherwise serve some sort of purpose to the plot. The book hardly had a plot and was basically just some annoying guy wandering around the city doing random shit and saying stupid as hell things. It was just bad.  &gt; You could do that with virtually any fact and assume the person who doesn't know it is stupid.  Well then that's the other thing. He asked where the ducks went to basically *friggen everyone.* You're telling me not a single goddamn person he ran into knew or could be bothered to utter the word ""migration?"""
t1_cl6wrm4,1,1,1,0,"&gt; Each chapter shows an event that reveals or reinforces an aspect of Holden's character  So basically the events are connected because the same person did stuff in them. That's honestly a pretty poor connection. If the entire point of the plot is just specifically to tell you stuff about this guy's personality, it's not that great of a plot imo.  &gt; he is afraid of sexuality in a fairly youthful manner  -  &gt; Holden has lost his innocence  -  &gt; It takes many chapters for the reader to really understand how and why Holden thinks.  See, all I got out of it was that Holden was a massive hypocrite, a bit of an idiot, and mentally unstable. That was basically it. That is not, to me, an interesting character. The disjointed happenings the author used to beat those aspects of this character into my head for no other reason than ""because he's the main character"" were not something I found to be well written.  &gt; Is a character who is insane suddenly not interesting to read about?  Is a character that is insane supposed to suddenly *be* interesting to read about? My point is that all of his personality can be summed up by ""tragedy broke his mind and sent him into a spiral of idiocy and insanity."" He was an insane hypocrite. That's all he was and that is utterly one dimensional.  There wasn't, as I recall, much of a showing of who he was before he lost his mind, so it doesn't even make for a compelling tragic tale to me. He was just some guy that suffered a lose and completely broke down in the most mundane, drawn out, and utterly frustrating way imaginable. I was a teen with depression while reading this book, and I've had people in my life die too. Him snapping because of those things isn't enough on its own to be either interesting or compelling to me."
t1_cl6xdwv,1,1,1,0,"&gt; Whether or not a character is stable doesn't determine how interesting they are and is irrelevant.  But my point is that's all he was. All of his issues can potentially be traced back to his instability.  &gt; Holden has issues no one addressed and no one cared about.  ...issues that stemmed from his instability.  &gt; He was directionless and suffering  ...because his brother died.  &gt; he perceives as fake and one dimensional  ..because he's unstable.  &gt; this was all building inside of him  ...ever since his brother died. He is completely and utterly defined by that one singular event. Yes, it was a tragic event, but we weren't shown how it effected him because we weren't shown the character he was before. All we saw was the aftermath, and so all we got was a one dimensional character with one defining trait - instability.  &gt; whether you liked Holden or not is your own opinion  Obviously. This is my interpretation of the book, and we're here discussing it because our interpretations differ. But also, I dislike it specifically because it is my own opinion that it is poorly written. The fact that a lot of people have written a lot of things about it only proves it's popular, not that it's well written. Well written is just as much of a subjective idea, and I'm entirely aware of that."
t1_cl88xn5,2,1,1,0,"It reminded me of being younger and getting pissed when other people would Lauph at me for not knowing something that might be considered common knowledge, but somebody has to explain things to you at some point, my parents never taught me very much at all, I'm guessing holdens parents were always too busy to explain anything to him so he had no context. "
t1_cl89ogw,1,1,1,0,"But I'd guess you weren't obsessed with a really well known answer to a specific question.

That's the part of it that bugs me more than anything, he was in a goddamn boarding school at the start of the book, you're telling me he couldn't find the answer to that question *at a school?*"
t1_cl89vmf,1,1,1,0,I think that's what the author is getting at. Nobody will help this kid with what is troubling him not even something so basic.
t1_cl8a4kq,1,1,1,0,"But it seems like a very extreme and unbelievable example to use for that. Part of why I don't see it as a well written book. He seemed sincere to me, so barring the idea that he was asking to see if anyone would answer, and assuming he genuinely didn't know...why couldn't he have gone to the friggen school library and found a book about ducks or even ask the goddamn librarian. Or a teacher for that matter. It's literally part of their job to answer questions, so unless he was at a really shitty school, it should have been a piece of cake for him to get that answer."
t1_cl6aecx,2,4,1,1,"Holden is suffering.  His brother died, his parents neglect him, his friend committed suicide while borrowing his sweater.  That's not generalized teen angst.  He is struggling with his own mental illness, and is profoundly sad and lonely.  When he tries to reach out to an adult he trusts (Mr. Antolini), he learns he has ulterior motives.  I don't understand people who don't have sympathy for Holden.  Is it because he's rich?  And you think that people who come from rich families have no right to feel deep emotional pain?  This is a story of an abandoned child doing his best to navigate his world without any kind of guide.  What's more sympathetic than that?  As far as my own personal love for the book, I can tell you that when I read it as a teenager, I had an epiphany-like experience of feeling like someone else in the world might actually understand me.  I was neglected, I was mentally ill and not getting treatment, and when Holden said it was the kind of cold where you felt like you were going to disappear every time you crossed the street, I thought *""Oh my God, somebody GETS me.""*  This book isn't for everyone, but for some people it is a profoundly validating experience.  Maybe you didn't suffer in the same way as Holden when you were a child.  Maybe you have a different kind of coping strategy, a different kind of resilience.  But Holden's voice is so true to how so many of us feel, when we read that book we feel as if J.D. Salinger has reached out and held our hand. "
t1_cbogk1v,5,5,5,1,"Tolkein directly addressed this sort of point in his letters.  &gt;Frodo deserved all honor because he spent every drop of his power of will and body, and that was just sufficient to bring him to the destined point, and no further. Few others, perhaps no others of his time would have got so far. Letter 192.  &gt;""The power of the ring would reach its maximum - impossible, I should say, for anyone to resist, especially after long possession, months of increasing torment, and when starved and exhausted."" Letter 246  http://www.americanidea.org/handouts/06240110.htm  &gt;'If you re-read all the passages dealing with Frodo and the Ring, I think you will see that not only was it quite impossible for him to surrender the Ring, in act or will, especially at its point of maximum power, but that this failure was adumbrated from far back.' 191  So it's quite possible that no one else would be strong willed enough to bring the ring to the mountain (though in the past individuals who could existed) and he was likely the most strong willed of the people nearby. The taxing journey would have also severely weakened people's ability to destroy it. Frodo had long since been corrupted and it would have never been possible for him to destroy it, even with a burst of will.  As to whether Sam could have done it.   &gt;""Wild fantasies arose in his mind; and he saw Samwise the Strong, Hero of the Age, striding with a flaming sword across the darkened land, and armies flocking to his call as he marched to the overthrow of Barad-dur. And then all the clouds rolled away, and the white sun shone, and at his command the vale of Gorgoroth became a garden of flowers and trees and brought forth fruit. He had only to put on the Ring and claim it for his own, and all this could be""  Sam was also being corrupted. I don't know if he'd have been able to throw it in.   &gt;'No, not everything, Mr. Frodo. And it hasn't failed, not yet. I took it, Mr. Frodo, begging your pardon. And I've kept it safe. It's round my neck now, and a terrible burden it is, too.' Sam fumbled for the Ring and its chain. 'But I suppose you must take it back.' Now it had come to it, Sam felt reluctant to give up the Ring and burden his master with it again.  &gt;'You've got it?' gasped Frodo. 'You've got it here? Sam you're a marvel!' Then quickly and strangely his tone changed. 'Give it to me!' he cried, standing up, holding out a trembling hand. 'Give it me at once! You can't have it!'  &gt;'All right, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam, rather startled. 'Here it is!' Slowly he drew the Ring out and passed the chain over his head. 'But you're in the land of Mordor now, sir; and when you get out, you'll see the Firey Mountain and all. You'll find the Ring very dangerous now, and very hard to bear. If it's too hard a job, I could share it with you, maybe?'  He already found it very hard to hand it over."
t1_cbognd1,1,1,1,0,"No one showed to be totally immune-- But several resisted the ring's corruption from varying proximities for varying times.

I doubt he was considerably tempted by that fantasy, even if he was a little. "
t1_cboiu19,1,1,1,0,"1. Frodo wouldn't have surrendered the ring willingly. Sam would have likely had to kill him.  2. Sam had worn the ring briefly, which would have likely corrupted him.

Frodo still would have likely put the ring on and left Sam. Until that point, Frodo was already cracking at the seams and Sam wasn't holding up well either.   If Sam's energies weren't spent fighting Gollum, it would have been spent hauling Frodo up. Also, the speculative willpower Frodo may or may not have had is kind of immaterial. If anything, the Ring had proven that its power to survive was strengthened at Mount Doom as it easily corrupted others.   Tolkien is even on record saying Frodo could not have given the Ring up at that point.
