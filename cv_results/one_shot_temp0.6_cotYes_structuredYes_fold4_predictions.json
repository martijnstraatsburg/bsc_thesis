In fact GZs friend (Taffy) that is on CNN every night used this same argument. In addition its the similar to what GZ defense is using in that he felt the beating he was taking was life threatening. We know now that his injuries were nowhere close to being life threatening. But what we do know that GZ knew is that police were on their way and people were around, I will admit that is unfair for me to say that as I wasn't the one that got punched, hindsight is 20/20. \n\nFor me it comes down to George Zimmerman is an **adult and trained neighborhood watchman**. GZ knew TM was a kid. At some point he should have identified who he was as he had plenty of opportunity. He should have never left his car, IMO he left his car to catch TM, there was no other reason for him to leave his car in the rain. He needs to be punished for his incompetence. \nPlease don't assume you know what I base my position on, I very mixed emotions on the entire thing and have gone back and forth on my position. And how the media spun it had really no affect on me. One guy is dead and the other guy life is probably ruined. Both could have and should have made better decisions, however one was an adult, the other was a kid. \n\nYou should really refrain from calling TM a thug, racist, street fighter, drug dealer etc..

You mention that the best books are ones like the Chamber of Secrets, but Voldemort didn't even really come into play until the end; the characters were more worried about the Basilisk (though they didn't know it was, in fact, a Basilisk). In PoA, there is supposed to be someone directly out to get Harry, which doesn't go for the first two. In my opinion, that's more of a danger.\n\nRegarding angst: books like The Goblet of Fire and The Order of the Phoenix are way, way more angsty. In fact, off the top of my head, all that I can really think about that qualifies as angst in PoA is when Harry contemplates going after Sirius Black (which isn't even necessarily teenage angst, seeing as it could happen to anyone), and Ron and Hermione's issues with each other. As a matter of fact, I think that one of the better parts of PoA is that develops characters in a much better way than the first two books, while not laying it on too much. The characters grow way more in this book than the first two, and there are way more moral issues and such.\n\nAnd yet, even though there's character development and such, one thing I really like about PoA is that it still retains similar flavour and charm from the first two books. However, it's the only year where disasters and other things don't ruin the year for the students, even though dark events are still unfolding. Things like the Boggart lesson and the Quidditch final are enjoyable because nothing like that really happens in other books. In the first book, everything was new and shiny; in the second, there were people being attacked; in the fourth book, there was the Triwizard Tournament; in the fifth, there was Umbridge; in the sixth, the anti-Voldemort movement was started, and the the last book was barely at Hogwarts. PoA mixes the danger of the second with the world-building of the first in a good way. \n\nIt's also a really good transition and set-up for the Voldemort-filled part of the series, and the ending isn't a perfect Hollywood ending like the first two. There are doubts and the real servant of Voldemort is on the loose at the end. It's less sweet. It's nice to have Harry save the day, win a million points for Gryffindor with his antics, and have his friends all cheer for him, but it's far more interesting to have an ending that leaves you with questions and doubts for the next book. Voldemort doesn't hurt Harry at the end, but his servant is off to resurrect him. \n\nAlso, I don't know why you're merely dismissing the backstory and time travel aspects. The backstory was really interesting. The time travel was plain cool. It was icing on the cake, but at least it can help in avoiding last place. \n\nFinally, the third book is, in my opinion, one of the best to re-read. For more intense books like the last one, a lot of the intensity/drama/action/suspense is lost when you re-read it. The PoA is a good mix of mystery and other stuff, so it's better for re-reading. \n\n**TL;DR, PoA has more danger, better character development and world-building, a better ending and re-read value, and lots of other cool factors, including time travel.**",

It was similar to Intro to Felt Surrogacy in that each character had secrets that would upset the others and all those secrets were put on the table throughout the episode. In Felt Surrogacy, the secrets they each hold are of very different magnitudes. Troy started a 50 acre fire, while Jeff bailed on a date and felt bad about it. Everyone treats their secrets as if they have the same weight to them, and at the end they have a very sappy \"aww, we can all feel better about this now\" moment. In Cooperative Polygraphy each person's secret is given the appropriate weight. There character's secrets aren't just about things they did, but things they did to each other. There isn't a final moment of sappy sitcom closure where all the harm is undone and everyone hugs. Instead they grow as people. They realize that they're not as nice as they all might think of themselves being. Things mattered this time around.",

Now it's possible that Mandy was drinking with no intention of banging the OP but that after enough alcohol, she couldn't control herself even though she expected she would be able to.

Ordinary civilians and bystanders can jump higher, run faster, and take more punishment than a normal human would be able to. For instance, Batman, an ordinary human at peak physical health, runs faster than Usain Bolt, regularly lifts more than the human world record, and recovers from injuries faster than should be humanly possible. The DC human brain is probably more shock-resistant than a normal human brain.\n\nIn Batman begins, Batman had every intention of having Gordon blow up the train tower which would cause the train to crash, and every intention of leaving Ra's al Ghul there to die. He said he wasn't killing him, he just wasn't saving him. That's just the same as Batman pulling the trigger on a gun and saying \"I am not killing you, the bullet is\". He made the plan, and executed it, knowing Ra's al Ghul would die.\n\nYou forget the point of Batman's no-kill rule. It isn't an arbitrary requirement he throws on himself for no reason. The no-kill rule is simply to hold himself back in the absence of public accountability, legal restrictions, or responsible partners (Robin is a kid. He doesn't count). When the cops fought Bane or when Gordon blew up the train tower, there were other people in the plot to ensure that Batman wasn't murdering out of petty revenge. The Batman can only kill out of absolute self-defense or under the eye of others to prevent himself from being the next Two-Face, Rorschach, or Ozymandias.",

    "body": "First of all, Dale is a much better role model than John Redcorn. Redcorn is a womanizing, selfish, greedy (as evidenced by how he's willing to drop Luanne's Manger Babies from his VHS distribution company), and all around pompous person (he thinks his shitty death metal band is the greatest thing ever). He's also an extremely anger filled man, constantly discussing taking revenge on \"the white man\". \n\nDale, albeit a little crazy and paranoid, is actually kind, caring, thoughtful and above all else, selfless (remember when he saved the Stick-Tec office by killing thousands of roaches with his bare hands? Or when he rushed to save Joseph from the alien overlords at the Marfa Lights? Or the countless times he's shown his devotion and love for his wife?). The only thing Dale really dislikes is Bill, for being so pathetic and disgusting, and Rusty Shackleford, for totally made up reasons. \n\nSo it's much better for Joseph to grow up a little weird if it means he gets to learn good, quality values. The only thing he'd learn from John Redcorn is how to be a selfish asshole who fucks any woman he can in a vendetta against an entire race of people. \n\nWe also see that Joseph thinks John Redcorn is a pretty weird dude in the Thanksgiving episode, so I'm pretty sure going to live with him would be pretty damaging to Joseph. Not to mention that John Redcorn doesn't know the first thing about parenting.   \n\nAlso, sure John Redcorn might be hurt that he doesn't get to raise Joseph, *but that's the price you pay when you stick your dick in another man's wife*. Seriously, fuck John Redcorn. I'm glad he has to silently suffer while watching Dale raise his kid. He's a piece of shit, so the resulting harm to him is negligible.\n\nAnd as other people said, Hank typically stays out of people's personal business. Even if it's totally fucked up, he tries to keep personal details like sexual relations completely secret (he doesn't even like Luanne using the bathroom in his and Peggy's room). He would *never* broach the subject of intimate sexual relations with his friends - he avoids those conversations at all costs (watch the episode where Connie gets her first period for ample evidence of this aversion). \n\nHe also sees how destructive divorce can be, thanks to Bill. Hank sort of sees the value in \"ignorance is bliss\" at least when it comes to Dale. Bill at least has a steady paying military job. Dale would be homeless trying to live off of Dale's Deadbug (we're constantly reminded that Nancy is the breadwinner, and we see in the episode where Nancy goes to work in Dallas that Dale cannot take care of himself). So it's actually better for Dale to not be privy to the true father of Joseph as well. \n\nIf Hank told Dale, and Dale believed him (which is also a stretch), then it would ruin pretty much everyone's lives who are involved in it. Dale becomes homeless, Joseph is now a child of divorced parents who realizes at 13 that he's a different race than he thought, Nancy would have to deal with the publicity that would likely result from this, and John Redcorn's life as he knows it comes crashing down once he has legal guardianship over a child (no more banging sluts when he's gotta take Joseph to football practice).",

It really could have been helpful for Poussey, she wanted to reach out but she couldn't because Suzanne was there to make sure she didn't 'snitch'. Healy still tried to change his behaviour and do something he thought could genuinely help the inmates.\n\nYou also have to remember that a prison counsellor isn't the same as a counsellor on the outside. A prison counsellor is not a therapist and may not even be able to tell someone is suicidal compared to being severely depressed, let alone provide the level of care needed for someone who is seriously considering suicide. His job isn't the same as an 'outside world' counsellor. He made a recommendation for Soso to get antidepressants, and without that recommendation she may not have gotten any medication whatsoever. Antidepressants have to be closely monitored by a medical doctor at the start of the course. That she didn't receive that care isn't Healy's fault, because he is not in any way qualified to monitor someone's reaction to medication, which often includes increased suicidal urges to begin with.",

    "body": "I suggest checking out the official patriots [rebuttal](http://wellsreportcontext.com/) to the Wells Report\nThere was  national media uproar about potentially deflated game balls.  If you were one of only a handful of locker room attendants who handled the balls, of course you would be interested if your name came up.  What kind of asshole would *not* tell his friend that his name came up in an interview with security. \nBrady knew he liked his balls at 12.5 psi.  He requested the locker room guys hand the refs a highlighted copy of the rule book so they knew what range it could be.  That requires inflating (and if necessary deflating if they've been over-inflated) the balls.  Needles are required for both inflating and deflating.\nThey claim they were referencing him trying to sell his game tickets.  But they claim the \"he\" that starts that quote wasn't referring to Brady.  It's one of the sketchier parts but is far from conclusive.\nThis was the week after the referees in a Jets game inflated the Patriots balls to 16 PSI, well over the legal limit.  Given that they were being yelled at for over-inflating the balls, discussing deflating would make sense.\nThis was in May 2014.  If they were deflating balls all the way back to the 2013-2014 season, then how did they end up getting surprised by 16psi balls during the Jets game in the 2014-2015 season?  They say it was a reference to losing weight.  The bit about ESPN was preceded by a discussion of getting free sneakers, which they were not allowed to do.  \nI would hope that Tom Brady and every major NFL star gives out signs gear for free for the lower-level team employees.  And, importantly, the Wells Report made no attempt to show that this was at all unusual for the Patriots or for NFL teams in general.\nYeah, guys whose job it is to inflate the balls need needles to work the pumps.  The request for cash clearly sounds like a joke, especially in the context of the rest of their text message jokes. \nAgain, players sign all kinds of stuff, I don't see any reason to suggest this was some kind of quid pro quo.  Unless you hear players or employees saying that it's rare for players to sign all kinds of stuff and give away used equipment, I don't think this is any evidence of anything.  And these were the guys who prepared his game balls.  It's important to keep those guys happy.  \nOk, admittedly destroying the phone was a bad idea, but: A) At that point, he wasn't going to give it to them anyway, so destroying didn't do anything to cover up actions. B) If Brady's lawyer were the one selecting which messages were relevant, then I don't really see how they were expecting to get any incriminating evidence of the phone anyway.  C) I think his claim that he didn't want to set a precedent of players having to turn over private cell phones or private text conversations is legit. D) Around the time of the appeal (although a bit too little, too late) he pulled the records of his text messages and said he was willing to attempt to recover the contents from the other peoples' phones.\nThe AFC championship game was unusual in the sense that it was delayed due to the late ending of the NFC championship game.  As a result the pregame timing was a little different, and the Officials Locker Room was crowded with people watching the end of the other game.",
