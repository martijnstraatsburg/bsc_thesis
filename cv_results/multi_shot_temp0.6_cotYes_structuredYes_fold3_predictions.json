    "body": "But does anything function alone with no other built in factors? For example, in high school debate there are two key factors that are used- How you say it (speech) and what you are saying (facts, arguments). But the majority of it for debate is how you say it so I'll take it instead that the majority of success will have to be because of luck or who you know instead of being able to do something or talent. \n\nLucky is defined by having good luck, luck being the force that seems to operate for good or ill in a person's life, as in shaping circumstances, events, or opportunities. I'll give 2 examples: one with a lot of luck but no talent and another one with a lot of talent but no luck. 1. Jim lands a job interview that he recently found in the paper the second he opens it. He goes to the job interview with all of his charm and best clothes. He finds that this attractive redhead is doing the interviews, seemingly her first time to be doing this so she is relatively laid back. Jim goes in her interview and does perfectly! He already knows all of the questions and talks in a smooth voice.  Now there is a portion to show coding.  After about 5 minutes she realizes that he doesn't know anything and tells him sorry. Now Bob walks in to another room that has a grumpy old man sitting there.  He asks the most difficult questions possible! Luckily as Bob is an experienced person with interviews and a talented coder, he answered the questions to the best of his ability and later blew the interviewers mind with his coding abilities. \n\nBob gets the job because of his experienced talent of interviews and amazing coding abilities that gets him through. Jim does not although he did perfectly with the easy questions but proved terribly in coding on the computer.",

Shortly after the second time, when the dog is just standing there, he shoots it.  You can see that the dog is standing on the sidewalk at least 5 or 6 feet away from the officer when he fires.  I'd understand if he shot it while the dog was in the act of trying to bite him but he clearly wasn't.  The dog was only threatening the officer when the officer threatened him.  But despite the threat not being imminent he shot the dog because he's incompetent.  \n\nAfter he realized it was a bad idea to try and grab the dog's leash, he should have stopped to think for a second and figured something better out.  The best solution would have been to uncuff the owner for a little second to secure the dog.  The owner wasn't violent and not a threat to the police, you can see he immediately complied when they asked to cuff him.  \n\nEven if they aren't going to uncuff a suspect, all cops have at least one form of non-lethal force.  Either a taser or pepper spray.  They also have training into when it's appropriate to use non-lethal vs lethal force.  Either one of these would have worked fantastically at taking down a dog, but the officer came over gun-drawn to deal with it.  Why did he need his gun out?  Why didn't he have his taser out instead?  Was there some situation where he thought he would need a gun going on there?  Clearly he made a major mistake in deciding what type of force to use.",

Then, the scuffle took place, but have you seen Zimmerman's face after the \"pummeling\"? No damage to his eyes, cheeks, fine a broken nose, but getting beaten to death? Nope, Zimmerman's lying about that. \n\nAlso, why should we simply believe that Zimmerman didn't START the fight? I love how people just simply assume Zimmerman's version was right, without questioning whether he shoved the teen (a violent act, but not one that would show in the autopsy). \n\nAlso, if he's getting beaten to death, he shoots a perfect shot to the chest, WITH someone on top of him waling on him with deadly punches??\n\nAs for the following, there's a conservative, a respected one who agrees with me.\n\nConservative intellectual George will echoed the same sentiment:\n\n\"Mr. Zimmerman says he was acting under this self-defense law, but he is said to have been recorded saying he pursued the person. You cannot be in pursuit and acting in self-defense.”\nhttp://www.mediaite.com/tv/george-will-on-trayvon-martin-stand-your-ground-law-is-a-bad-idea/\n\nFinally, if I'm armed, and this is just me, but I'm going to make sure that I'm a distance from a potential threat, so that I can draw the weapon. I'm not getting inches away from someone who could hurt me, or prevent me from grabbing the gun. But then again, that's me, obviously Zimmerman \"somehow\" knew, without warning the kid that he was armed, that he'd be able to both confront the potential \"perp\" in close proximity, possibly get into a fight, but also miraculously pull his gun out without a problem.",

What attracted Zimmerman's attention was a man wearing a hood walking between houses at night, in a neighborhood that had been troubled by burglaries.\n\nLets put this another way. Is there any actual evidence to suggest that Zimmerman is a racist? This seems to be an assertion that's being made between the lines without any real support. \nSadly, yes. I'd say it's conditional: an older, clean-cut black man wearing a suit? No. A young black man wearing certain kinds of fashion, sporting tattoos and gold teeth? Yes. Is that racist? I'd argue no. Is it a form of prejudice? That's arguable - clothing and manner of dress are used for a variety of reasons, but one being to signify a certain set of beliefs and values, an adherence to a certain social \"code\". \n\nThe fact is that inner city/ghetto culture in this country has rightfully earned a reputation for thuggish behavior. It isn't George Zimmerman's fault that if you open a hip-hop club in a city, even in a nice neighborhood, you have to pay for ten times more security and still deal with a higher frequency of fights and gang activity. That's just a fact, and we can either own up to it and figure out how to deal with it, or we can go off into some hippie-dippy la-la land of ignorant political correctness. It isn't a matter of skin color, it's a matter of cultural mores and values promulgated by different quarters of society. But it is an important matter that needs to be addressed: the epidemic of violence in the inner city is claiming a lot of lives, and costing a lot more their livelihoods. If we really care about our children and our countrymen, we will summon up the courage to stop looking for scapegoats and face up to this serious problem. Trayvon Martin, who by all accounts knocked a guy onto the ground and then continued beating him mercilessly, is a sad victim of this culture, as are *so many* young black men and women. Look at the homicide rates in Chicago, look at the faces of the victims. Look at the perpetrators... it's not a bunch of George Zimmermans.\n\nI feel tremendous sympathy for the kid's family. I feel tremendous sympathy for the kid himself... he could be so many kids I grew up with, called friend, ate dinner with. We've all made mistakes, and you and I, dear reader, are still here to talk about it, able to learn from them and carry on with our lives. Sadly, Trayvon isn't still with us, and will never have that opportunity to learn from mistakes. He didn't deserve that fate. \n\nBut the reality is that George Zimmerman is not ultimately to blame for his fate... George Zimmerman had no other choice, if we take a rational reading of events. Anyone who says they would passively lay there and let themselves be pinned to the ground and beaten into unconsciousness or worse on the street is either lying or hopelessly naive, and probably both. What's to blame for Trayvon's fate is a culture that teaches our young men that they are not men unless they solve their problems with violence, that respect is synonymous with beating people up, and using your words and your head instead of your fists is cowardly, and that running away from a meaningless confrontation is a shameful act rather than a wise one. It's a fate that will continue to befall an unfortunate number of us, and disproportionately those of us who are black or poor or from the 'hood, until we steel ourselves to confronting the real problem.",

The most compelling part of your argument is that 12 year olds can still say wise things, but you still cannot expect them to have the same moral agency as an adult even if they do act more mature than their age and participate in war. It's why juveniles and adults are not tried in the same courts in the real world. There are a few things here and there I don't agree with but they do not affect the integrity of your argument. I still have a personal preference for Korra the Avatar though :)\n\nNo, never really got into Harry Potter, I've only read the first and part of the fifth book and watched the first and fourth movies.",

Unless he is not known to be the Avatar until later on (like aang was).  \n\nAang left because he was upset.  but he was just going out for a ride, I is not as if his intention was to incase himself in ice for a century.  \n\nWhen you are 12, and someone says that you are all of a sudden super important, and you cant be with your friends or your only father figure, that is going to be pretty tramatizing.  It was his intention to leave and cool down.  But even in the first book we see aang regreting his actions.  He did not intend to be gone long, just to cool off.  \n\nHe didnt have the resources until he made them available to himself.  He didnt have any teachers or guidance, and the world was literally against him.  He had to seek out and find earth benders and fire benders to teach him.  not an easy thing to do when the fire nation wants you dead.  \n\nKorra had that support system.  I understand that she didnt have an ideal childhood.  But if you think that being in what was basically a boarding school where you learn to use super powers is the same as being hunted by an entire nation of people, you are very wrong.  \n\nAang and Korra are also very differnt people.  Raised differently and with different mindsets and approaches to life.  I dont think one or the other is better.  I think they have different strengths and weaknesses.  I dont think Korra would have been capable of simply stopping Ozai.  And i dont think she would have been capable of learning from Zuko either.  But, i think she would have been able to learn from aang's first firebending teacher, even without mastery of earth.  \n\nSo, they are different.  But i dont think korra is better.  that isnt to say that she is worse, i just think that they are different. \n\nSome of Korra's character is wrapped around young adult love and \"who is going to take me to prom\" style stuff, but i dont think that is really who she is. so i am not really thinking about that.",

CMV.\n\nI believe that Lee Harvey Oswald assassinated JFK using a single rifle, fired all of the shots that killed him and wounded Gov. Connally, and did so as an individual actor (not as the agent of a nation or organized group). My knowledge of the Kennedy Assassination is admittedly limited; I've studied it in school and participated in several university level class discussions about the investigations and conspiracies surrounding the issue. After looking at the conclusions reached by the Warren Commission, I was somewhat skeptical of the notion that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, but the HSCA report clarifies some of the issues surrounding the timing and circumstances of the assassination, and leaves open the idea that Oswald may have had a partner. Additionally, I do feel that the events following the assassination are slightly suspicious (notably LBJ appointing and overseeing the Warren Commission), but are not at present sufficient for me to discount the accepted explanation of the assassination.  The number of conspiracy or alternate theories surrounding the assassination is prodigious and confusing, to say the least, but I am willing to accept an alternate theory and CMV if someone can present a compelling alternate explanation of the JFK assassination supported by clear and provable facts.",
