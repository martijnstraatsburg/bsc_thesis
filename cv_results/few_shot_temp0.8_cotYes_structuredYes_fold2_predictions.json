The *first* person to shoot will kill the other *and* avoid being shot themselves, so there is no reason to wait unless you want to die.\n\nThe homeowner would be a nut to not shoot the thief as soon as he sees he has a gun, and the thief would be a nut to not shoot the homeowner as soon as he sees he has a gun.

All \"evidence\" for a second shooter can be explained away in a very logical way. I've also heard a second hand account of a conversation a friend of mine had with the marksman instructor who trained Oswald in the military. He testifies Oswald was a good enough shot.\n\n- We'll likely never know if Oswald was hired, but I believe he was hired by a friend of Communism, either a government (Russia, Cuba) or group (Communist Party members), most likely Russia. Kennedy was a threat because I believe Russia feared him escalating the Cold War into an actual war, and despite their hard attitude, they didn't want a nuclear war either.\n\n- I believe the Mafia thought they would be blamed, as they weren't too fond of Kennedy, and so they were happy to help out when asked to kill Oswald in revenge. They never knew, but the same people who hired LHO hired them. They chose Ruby because, he loved America, and he was terminal. He didn't have long anyway, so he was a low risk to talk. Once Ruby dies in prison, all loose ends are tied.\n\n- No one within the American government was involved. It was not an inside job.\n\nAgain, I draw these conclusions based on what I've read.

Okay, you’re starting to convince me that there was more at play than I initially suspected, but I have a few more questions that you might be able to clear up.\n\n* You’ve convinced me that Oswald acted alone, or at least plausibly could have made the shots that killed Kennedy and wounded Gov. Connally. Re-examining the distance Oswald was shooting from and the fact that he did actually miss twice, it fits that someone with his marksmanship skills would’ve done poorly but still hit his target.\n\n* I’m still skeptical about why a communist group would want to kill JFK. You’re right to point out that post-assassination most of the American public was more concerned with the effect the attack had on domestic affairs and the personal lives of the First Lady, etc. Yet that ignores the fact that LBJ immediately succeeding Kennedy led to increases in tensions with the USSR both in the short term and more over in the long term. I still don’t see why communist groups would want to kill Kennedy in Dallas; why didn’t they kill him around the Bay of Pigs or the Cuban Missile Crisis? I also feel like you brush off them trusting Oswald; if he was actually hired and then apprehended, he would have still had plenty of time to tell one of the Dallas police officers or FBI agents who interrogated him for several hours at least some degree of information about who had hired him. Sure, the FBI might have thought he was a nut, but in the immediate aftermath of a presidential assassination, I seriously doubt that they wouldn’t have followed up on every piece of information he provided, regardless of how crazy it sounded (and communists hiring an assassin in the political climate of the early 60’s isn’t that crazy). Sure, Oswald *didn’t* rat on the people who hired him (aside from saying he was a “patsy”) but the odds that he *might* have still seem to me to preclude a communist group from hiring such a lose cannon (who, again, defected *away* from the USSR despite initially professing his love for the Soviets).\n\n* If you can convince me on the Russia/Communist angle, I’m starting to buy the next link in the chain, of Mafia involvement. That said, I don’t see the evidence in your argument for Mafia involvement. Sure, they *could* have, and I see their motivations, but what is your actual proof for Mafia involvement?",

    "body": "I went to and worked at the same camp for 11 years. From my understanding (and experience), camp is almost purely a social experience. When you are young, it is a social experience where you learn how to become friends with children of your own sex without the aid of your parents. As you get older, it is a social experience befriending (and other activities...) people of the opposite sex. I don't know if this makes camp all about \"acceptance,\" but it definitely makes the camp owners want to foster a friendly environment.\n\nIn regards to pranks, at my camp they used to be condoned; however, the pranks progressed year after year, become more and more vagrant (for lack of a better word). When my camp switched owners, the first year of under new ownership, a particularly ridiculous prank occurred (I wouldn't even call it a prank; some idiots stole candy from the Canteen). It was the owner's first year so he just put out a zero tolerance policy towards pranks and the lot. People still do them, but they are much smaller and more discreet than before. \n\nIn regards to protecting kids, I think a camp should foster a safe environment, especially for younger children. By age 12, most parents are okay if their children get hurt at camp (i.e. when they would get a call from the camp, they would say it happens), but for younger children (ages 8-11) parents were very scared whenever they heard their children were hurt. This is understandable and I this is why I accept trying to make camp a safe environment. At these young ages, camp is literally all about the activities to the kids; when they are older, camp is about the friendships and relationships they make. If the focal point of camp for these younger children doesn't appear safe to a parent considering sending their child there, then the camp would be failing one of its goals. \n\nThat's at least what I think about it anyway.",

    "body": "I'm not sure that I would say one is definitively better than the other, but four years at that age makes a huge difference.  While you acknowledge the age gap and Aang's age at the time, I don't think you give him the leeway that he probably deserves.  \n\nIf we look at a 12 year old versus a 16 year old in our (or at least an American context), it's night and day.  While the 12 year old is struggling through the early stages of puberty, trying to find their way in 7th/8th grade, and beginning to learn about teenage life, the 16 year old is already living it.  While a person isn't necessarily super mature at 16, they are certainly going to be more mature than any 12 year old on average.\n\nHere's a kid who is born in desperate times, and expected to save the world.  That's pretty heavy if you're an adult, much less a 12 year old child.  I look back to what I was doing when I was 12 and I can tell you I wouldn't be ready to digest the notion of saving the world in a literal sense.  \nThis is because he does not want to kill, nor does he think he is capable of doing so.  I mean, he's scared too, but he doesn't know if he can beat Ozai much less kill him if he did win the fight.  Again, 12 year old.  Asking a 12 year old to perform the coup de grace is pretty gnarly.  It felt a little deus ex machina-like when the lion turtle gave him an alternate solution, but I had no trouble believing a young kid would be pretty freaked out by the implication that he had to kill someone.\n\nIn reality, Aang's whining is actually a pretty accurate portrayal of what an actual 12 year old acts like.  He has bursts of brilliance and is indeed more mature than most real 12 year olds, but his character was written extremely well.  Air nomads don't like to be held to one spot -- and by extension, I'd assume they wouldn't like to be held down by destiny.  Couple his background with his age, and you have a pretty darn good 12 year old character.\n\nIs he \"better\" than Korra? I'm not sure anyone can really settle that (not right now anyway).  However, I do think you're being a bit too harsh on Aang.",

    "body": "ooooooh interesting question. I felt like I had a lot of crushes when I was a kid. I did the same things--the acting strangely, the telling good friends I had a crush on x, etc etc etc. I also remember obsessing about the crush object and imagining out all sorts of weird narrative scenarios where I have to rescue them or we both realize we're in love through some improbable situation. Strangely at the time it felt a lot like a medieval courtly love, like abelard and heloise--a feeling of intense devotion and obsession, the sense that material signs of love like kissing or dates would \"ruin\" it. So in that sense I agree with you, I think. I even worked up the nerve to tell one girl I liked her in 7th grade, after spending months building up to it, and when I finally did she said \"yeah, I know\" and my mind went blank and I had literally NO IDEA what to do next. Nothing happened and we continued being normal friends. \n\nBut even now (I'm 25 now) and I can get sort of obsessive about certain girls in the same way--just idealizing them and thinking about how great they are all the time and how they complete me. It's a mode of attraction which makes for a lot of unrequited love and, also, makes me act like an ass. This happens ESPECIALLY if I wait a really long time to make a move on someone I like. The way I see it, a crush is like an investment of hope. You dump some imagination into what it would like to be with that person, and then that image feeds you a certain shining. Even though it can slow action, because the reality of what that idealized person actually IS breaks through the illusion which sustains you for so long. ANYWAYS this is all to say while you're right that children don't have any sexual component to their crushes, the fantasy and imagination to evoke romantic feelings can still work. Kids develop those kinds of feelings early on through parental behavior, through culture, etc etc etc. What do you think?",
