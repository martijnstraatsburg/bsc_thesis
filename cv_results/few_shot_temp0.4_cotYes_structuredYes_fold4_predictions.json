The distance was less than 100 yards (Marines train up to 500 meters, the 50s and the 100 targets are basically \"freebies\")\n\n3) Out of ~180 witnesses there, 138 of them said they heard three shots (consistent of the single shooter explanation) \n\n4) Oswald shot the cop and then ducked into the theater. Brewer (a store clerk who said he saw Oswald acting suspicious) was the one who reported him, not for not paying for the movie, but rather for acting suspicious. Given that the POTUS (And a cop) were just shot, sending 20 cops wouldn't be unheard of.\n\n5) Actually if you shoot a large hard sphere filled with goo on the inside, the result is that the object will come back at you. \n\nexample here: http://youtu.be/iSg6XwXe6WQ?t=26m53s\n\nAnd my main point is... there is 0 evidence of any other shooter.

It even looks like its paws may have made contact with the guy, but it's hard to tell from this angle and quality. But it was definitely starting to attack.\n\nUnless you have good reason to believe it wasn't attacking. Hit me. After all this is CMV. \n\nAlso, regarding tasers, if it was a human adult taser, that may have likely killed the dog as well. I'm admittedly limited in knowledge on tasers and their use in law enforcement, but if TASER Int'l themselves can no longer legally advertise their products as \"non-lethal,\" then I'd hesitate to say they should have gone that route. I'm pretty sure that animal control is equipped with tasers of smaller voltages for smaller animals. But again, I suck at tasers, so if anyone wants to correct me then I'm up for it.\n\nAlso yeah the arrest was unwarranted and legislation to prevent recording of the police is stupid. That's not the issue at hand though. It *should* be the issue at hand, but everyone's all up in arms over the fact that the dog died, not over bad legislation or bad police work. Everyone's mad at the wrong shit. They're calling the police department, not the state Congress.",

Korra was confined to the Southern Water Tribe and had her teachers shipped to her while she didn't know very much about the outside world. Aang was fairly spiritual and able to easily get into the Spirit World while it took Korra most of the first two books to get to that point. \n\nI don't discount the struggle, but Aang certainly made things worse for himself. He would have had an easier time had he not gone into stasis. Assuming that he would be able to fend off the attackers at the Air Temples, the Water Tribes and the Earth Kingdom were not withered by the Hundred Year War. The Fire Nation had nowhere near the foothold on a global scale as they had a hundred years later so it would be easier for Aang to bid his time and train. Compare the \"final showdowns\": the very elderly Sozin with no combat skills other than bending and his successor who was just a baby, versus Ozai in his prime and his prodigy heiress who was literally one of the best benders in the world. There would also be a larger number of firebenders more sympathetic to the Avatar willing to teach him; he has friends in the Fire Nation. Basically, his potential allies would have been stronger before his stasis than after. \n\nI strongly disagree that his gang was ineffective. Team Avatar 1 literally taught Aang the other elements. Katara taught Aang after she surpassed his skill in the NWT and Pakku had nothing else to teach her, Toph taught him earthbending, Zuko mentored him in firebending. I can hardly call them ineffective when they taught Aang. Meanwhile, comic relief Bolin and angst Mako....yuck. They couldn't even hold off Desna and Eska at the spirit portals. \n\nLastly, I argue that Aang soldiered on because he felt that he had no other choice, but not because he truly wanted to.",

    "body": "You're comparing apples to oranges here.  Aang's story arc was acceptance of his role as the avatar.  Remember he only found out he was the Avatar a few days before he fled.  He was 12, and he was faced with this overwhelming burden of fighting a war. The series ends with him being a fully realized Avatar at the age of 12/13 and fully accepting his duties because he found a way to harmonize his beliefs with his duties.  \n\nKorra's character arc is completely different.  She's already done that. She realized she was the Avatar at the age of 4.  She was raised in peace time and security. \n\nAlso, lets look at what being the avatar meant to both Korra and Aang.  For Aang it meant losing all of his friends, losing his teacher, dedicating himself to years more training when he thought he only had to master one element, and fight a looming war with the dangerous fire nation. For Korra, it meant she was instantly elevated to the level of a celebrity. He family (which was already royalty from the Northern Water Tribe) gained even more prestige. She was given the finest teachers, and basically lived in luxury from birth to the beginning of the series.  Throw on the differences in age and training and I think it's really unfair to compare the two.",

    "body": "I don't agree there was zero conflict. She felt the White Lotus was confining her. All of the previous Avatars got to travel the world while she gets stuck in a compound where her life is scripted. She didn't have any friends her age until she got to Republic City whereas Aang references Kuzon, Bumi, and the other Air Nomad children. Aang wasn't confined or ostracized from his friends until he was told he was the Avatar. He doesn't know his parents as that is Air Nomad custom, but otherwise it seemed he had more of a childhood than Korra did, who was confined to her compound for training. \n\nThe scenarios are different. Aang was told he was the Avatar pretty late and he had not yet been trained. In fact, being taken away from Gyatso for Avatar training was literally the reason for running away. He didn't give it a chance. \n\nI made another comment below - Aang refused the resources given to him until he was put in dire circumstances. It's different than not having had those resources at all.",

    "body": "An eight year old boy says \"When I grow up, I want to be an astronaut.\"\n\nOf course, from his perspective, he genuinely means it. He's seen an astronaut in a movie, maybe, and thinks it looks cool. He has no actual understanding of what an astronaut does, or how rigid and dangerous is. He has no idea that when he turns 12 he's going to discover how much he  actually hates the boring work of astronomy and physics, and that he's not really into working out and prefers writing poetry. By the time he's an adult, being an astronaut is the LAST thing he wants to be.\n\nBut that doesn't mean it's not 'genuine' when he said it as a kid. Kids are nothing if not genuine. What it means is that he said it in the way kids say all things: uninformed, mostly emotional, imitating adult behaviors and media depictions with little real understanding. From his perspective, he really does want to be an astronaut, and from an adult perspective, we know that's cute precisely because it's such a child's understanding of the world; that's why we say \"Awww\".\n\nChildhood crushes are the same way. Of course they're absolutely nothing like adult crushes. Of course kids have none of the vital information (like, say, their sexual preferences) that will shape their adult desires. A childhood crush is much more like \"play\", but to kids, play has all the emotional weight of real action. It's incredibly different from an adult crush, but that doesn't make it false or worse, lying to oneself.",

If the entire point of the plot is just specifically to tell you stuff about this guy's personality, it's not that great of a plot imo.\n-\n-\nSee, all I got out of it was that Holden was a massive hypocrite, a bit of an idiot, and mentally unstable. That was basically it. That is not, to me, an interesting character. The disjointed happenings the author used to beat those aspects of this character into my head for no other reason than \"because he's the main character\" were not something I found to be well written.\nIs a character that is insane supposed to suddenly *be* interesting to read about? My point is that all of his personality can be summed up by \"tragedy broke his mind and sent him into a spiral of idiocy and insanity.\" He was an insane hypocrite. That's all he was and that is utterly one dimensional.\n\nThere wasn't, as I recall, much of a showing of who he was before he lost his mind, so it doesn't even make for a compelling tragic tale to me. He was just some guy that suffered a lose and completely broke down in the most mundane, drawn out, and utterly frustrating way imaginable. I was a teen with depression while reading this book, and I've had people in my life die too. Him snapping because of those things isn't enough on its own to be either interesting or compelling to me.",

All of his issues can potentially be traced back to his instability.\n...issues that stemmed from his instability.\n...because his brother died.\n..because he's unstable.\n...ever since his brother died. He is completely and utterly defined by that one singular event. Yes, it was a tragic event, but we weren't shown how it effected him because we weren't shown the character he was before. All we saw was the aftermath, and so all we got was a one dimensional character with one defining trait - instability.\nObviously. This is my interpretation of the book, and we're here discussing it because our interpretations differ. But also, I dislike it specifically because it is my own opinion that it is poorly written. The fact that a lot of people have written a lot of things about it only proves it's popular, not that it's well written. Well written is just as much of a subjective idea, and I'm entirely aware of that.",

I also financed the rest. \n\nThe surgery was completely painless, but the week after that felt like I had a torn contact. It hurt, yes, but was very uncomfortable. That lasted about two weeks. Several times I had to pull over while driving to work because my eyes hurt so bad, but I'm photosensitive so the surgery isn't solely to blame. \n\nSince then my eyes have felt great. They were very good after surgery, but one eye has slightly diminished. The eye doctor told me that this will be a good thing in the next fifteen or twenty years and will prevent me from needing reading glasses. In the meantime I do not need contacts or glasses. \n\nI cycle and rock climb (and run, swim, weight lift, etc., etc.). Most things I enjoyed were impossible in glasses and as I got older it was harder to wear contacts. If you can afford the surgery I would recommend it. The younger you are the better investment it is.",

This meant losing/breaking glasses, spending time in the morning putting contacts in and out, worry about contacts before going to into a pool, etc. The cost of lasik well justifies getting rid of those hassles not to mention that the actual monetary savings. \n\nI remember for the first few weeks after lasik I would be just so thankful to wake up each morning having crystal clear vision. Its now become normal to me but even several years later it will pop into my head and I would think about how awesome lasik is. Cannot recommend it enough.\n\nThe one part of my experience that differed from the commenter above is that I never experienced dry eyes. Actually I differed a little from your post in that I really didn't have any pain either. Maybe lucky? I also paid significantly less than you stated (about half) but that was in part because I was referred to doctor by my sister. If you happen to live in Southern California I recommend the doctor.",
