All of the previous Avatars got to travel the world while she gets stuck in a compound where her life is scripted. She didn't have any friends her age until she got to Republic City whereas Aang references Kuzon, Bumi, and the other Air Nomad children. Aang wasn't confined or ostracized from his friends until he was told he was the Avatar. He doesn't know his parents as that is Air Nomad custom, but otherwise it seemed he had more of a childhood than Korra did, who was confined to her compound for training. \n\nThe scenarios are different. Aang was told he was the Avatar pretty late and he had not yet been trained. In fact, being taken away from Gyatso for Avatar training was literally the reason for running away. He didn't give it a chance. \n\nI made another comment below - Aang refused the resources given to him until he was put in dire circumstances. It's different than not having had those resources at all.",

This meant losing/breaking glasses, spending time in the morning putting contacts in and out, worry about contacts before going to into a pool, etc. The cost of lasik well justifies getting rid of those hassles not to mention that the actual monetary savings. \n\nI remember for the first few weeks after lasik I would be just so thankful to wake up each morning having crystal clear vision. Its now become normal to me but even several years later it will pop into my head and I would think about how awesome lasik is. Cannot recommend it enough.\n\nThe one part of my experience that differed from the commenter above is that I never experienced dry eyes. Actually I differed a little from your post in that I really didn't have any pain either. Maybe lucky? I also paid significantly less than you stated (about half) but that was in part because I was referred to doctor by my sister. If you happen to live in Southern California I recommend the doctor.",
