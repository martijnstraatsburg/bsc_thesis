There are lots of people that come across good opportunities, but many of them are either unprepared for them or do not pounce on them when they appear so the luck is squandered.\n\nThe extremely successful position themselves to take advantage of every lucky break that comes along.\n\nSo this isn't exactly a refutation of exactly what you said. But perhaps it might change how you view luck in a more general way. A lot of times the more successful didn't have more luck than others, but they were able to better take advantage of the luck they had.",

So i ended up doing some volunteer work at a homeless shelter. Now before this my experience with people who were homeless was very limited and i would say a bit negative. Homeless people. Seemed to me as just people who were drug addicts / alcoholics / etc. so anyway back to volunteering at the shelter. I ended up talking with a few guys about their lives and pasts and it was fascinating the things that they had done and also the unfortunate circumstances / decisions that led to where they are now. I also ended up playing a 3 hour game of chess which ended in a stalemate. Most of these guys were really intelligent and it surprised me to some degree. Anyway after that my view of those who are homeless has shifted a lot to seeing each person as an individual with their own unique past and not simply as a collective of people who are homeless, and that there are a lot of hard working homeless people out there who have jobs and families but they just can't afford the cost o living.",

It even looks like its paws may have made contact with the guy, but it's hard to tell from this angle and quality. But it was definitely starting to attack.\n\nUnless you have good reason to believe it wasn't attacking. Hit me. After all this is CMV. \n\nAlso, regarding tasers, if it was a human adult taser, that may have likely killed the dog as well. I'm admittedly limited in knowledge on tasers and their use in law enforcement, but if TASER Int'l themselves can no longer legally advertise their products as \"non-lethal,\" then I'd hesitate to say they should have gone that route. I'm pretty sure that animal control is equipped with tasers of smaller voltages for smaller animals. But again, I suck at tasers, so if anyone wants to correct me then I'm up for it.\n\nAlso yeah the arrest was unwarranted and legislation to prevent recording of the police is stupid. That's not the issue at hand though. It *should* be the issue at hand, but everyone's all up in arms over the fact that the dog died, not over bad legislation or bad police work. Everyone's mad at the wrong shit. They're calling the police department, not the state Congress.",

    "body": "I've read almost every report, theory, you name it, I've read it about the JFK assassination, including about 100 hours of playtime in \"JFK: Reloaded.\"\n\nMy theory is this...\n\n- Oswald was the only shooter. All \"evidence\" for a second shooter can be explained away in a very logical way. I've also heard a second hand account of a conversation a friend of mine had with the marksman instructor who trained Oswald in the military. He testifies Oswald was a good enough shot.\n\n- We'll likely never know if Oswald was hired, but I believe he was hired by a friend of Communism, either a government (Russia, Cuba) or group (Communist Party members), most likely Russia. Kennedy was a threat because I believe Russia feared him escalating the Cold War into an actual war, and despite their hard attitude, they didn't want a nuclear war either.\n\n- I believe the Mafia thought they would be blamed, as they weren't too fond of Kennedy, and so they were happy to help out when asked to kill Oswald in revenge. They never knew, but the same people who hired LHO hired them. They chose Ruby because, he loved America, and he was terminal. He didn't have long anyway, so he was a low risk to talk. Once Ruby dies in prison, all loose ends are tied.\n\n- No one within the American government was involved. It was not an inside job.\n\nAgain, I draw these conclusions based on what I've read. There are \"experts\" out there who would agree this is all plausible. What do you think?",

    "body": "I went to and worked at the same camp for 11 years. From my understanding (and experience), camp is almost purely a social experience. When you are young, it is a social experience where you learn how to become friends with children of your own sex without the aid of your parents. As you get older, it is a social experience befriending (and other activities...) people of the opposite sex. I don't know if this makes camp all about \"acceptance,\" but it definitely makes the camp owners want to foster a friendly environment.\n\nIn regards to pranks, at my camp they used to be condoned; however, the pranks progressed year after year, become more and more vagrant (for lack of a better word). When my camp switched owners, the first year of under new ownership, a particularly ridiculous prank occurred (I wouldn't even call it a prank; some idiots stole candy from the Canteen). It was the owner's first year so he just put out a zero tolerance policy towards pranks and the lot. People still do them, but they are much smaller and more discreet than before. \n\nIn regards to protecting kids, I think a camp should foster a safe environment, especially for younger children. By age 12, most parents are okay if their children get hurt at camp (i.e. when they would get a call from the camp, they would say it happens), but for younger children (ages 8-11) parents were very scared whenever they heard their children were hurt. This is understandable and I this is why I accept trying to make camp a safe environment. At these young ages, camp is literally all about the activities to the kids; when they are older, camp is about the friendships and relationships they make. If the focal point of camp for these younger children doesn't appear safe to a parent considering sending their child there, then the camp would be failing one of its goals. \n\nThat's at least what I think about it anyway.",

He was 12, and he was faced with this overwhelming burden of fighting a war. The series ends with him being a fully realized Avatar at the age of 12/13 and fully accepting his duties because he found a way to harmonize his beliefs with his duties.  \n\nKorra's character arc is completely different.  She's already done that. She realized she was the Avatar at the age of 4.  She was raised in peace time and security. \n\nAlso, lets look at what being the avatar meant to both Korra and Aang.  For Aang it meant losing all of his friends, losing his teacher, dedicating himself to years more training when he thought he only had to master one element, and fight a looming war with the dangerous fire nation. For Korra, it meant she was instantly elevated to the level of a celebrity. He family (which was already royalty from the Northern Water Tribe) gained even more prestige. She was given the finest teachers, and basically lived in luxury from birth to the beginning of the series.  Throw on the differences in age and training and I think it's really unfair to compare the two.",

Unless he is not known to be the Avatar until later on (like aang was).  \n\nAang left because he was upset.  but he was just going out for a ride, I is not as if his intention was to incase himself in ice for a century.  \n\nWhen you are 12, and someone says that you are all of a sudden super important, and you cant be with your friends or your only father figure, that is going to be pretty tramatizing.  It was his intention to leave and cool down.  But even in the first book we see aang regreting his actions.  He did not intend to be gone long, just to cool off.  \n\nHe didnt have the resources until he made them available to himself.  He didnt have any teachers or guidance, and the world was literally against him.  He had to seek out and find earth benders and fire benders to teach him.  not an easy thing to do when the fire nation wants you dead.  \n\nKorra had that support system.  I understand that she didnt have an ideal childhood.  But if you think that being in what was basically a boarding school where you learn to use super powers is the same as being hunted by an entire nation of people, you are very wrong.  \n\nAang and Korra are also very differnt people.  Raised differently and with different mindsets and approaches to life.  I dont think one or the other is better.  I think they have different strengths and weaknesses.  I dont think Korra would have been capable of simply stopping Ozai.  And i dont think she would have been capable of learning from Zuko either.  But, i think she would have been able to learn from aang's first firebending teacher, even without mastery of earth.  \n\nSo, they are different.  But i dont think korra is better.  that isnt to say that she is worse, i just think that they are different. \n\nSome of Korra's character is wrapped around young adult love and \"who is going to take me to prom\" style stuff, but i dont think that is really who she is. so i am not really thinking about that.",
