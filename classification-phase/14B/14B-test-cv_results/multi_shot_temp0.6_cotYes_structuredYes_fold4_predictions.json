    "body": "But does anything function alone with no other built in factors? For example, in high school debate there are two key factors that are used- How you say it (speech) and what you are saying (facts, arguments). But the majority of it for debate is how you say it so I'll take it instead that the majority of success will have to be because of luck or who you know instead of being able to do something or talent. \n\nLucky is defined by having good luck, luck being the force that seems to operate for good or ill in a person's life, as in shaping circumstances, events, or opportunities. I'll give 2 examples: one with a lot of luck but no talent and another one with a lot of talent but no luck. 1. Jim lands a job interview that he recently found in the paper the second he opens it. He goes to the job interview with all of his charm and best clothes. He finds that this attractive redhead is doing the interviews, seemingly her first time to be doing this so she is relatively laid back. Jim goes in her interview and does perfectly! He already knows all of the questions and talks in a smooth voice.  Now there is a portion to show coding.  After about 5 minutes she realizes that he doesn't know anything and tells him sorry. Now Bob walks in to another room that has a grumpy old man sitting there.  He asks the most difficult questions possible! Luckily as Bob is an experienced person with interviews and a talented coder, he answered the questions to the best of his ability and later blew the interviewers mind with his coding abilities. \n\nBob gets the job because of his experienced talent of interviews and amazing coding abilities that gets him through. Jim does not although he did perfectly with the easy questions but proved terribly in coding on the computer.",

    "body": "If we believe Zimmerman's statements, and the police as well as a jury found no apparent reason not to, Zimmerman did not know Martin's race when he began following him. What attracted Zimmerman's attention was a man wearing a hood walking between houses at night, in a neighborhood that had been troubled by burglaries.\n\nLets put this another way. Is there any actual evidence to suggest that Zimmerman is a racist? This seems to be an assertion that's being made between the lines without any real support. \nSadly, yes. I'd say it's conditional: an older, clean-cut black man wearing a suit? No. A young black man wearing certain kinds of fashion, sporting tattoos and gold teeth? Yes. Is that racist? I'd argue no. Is it a form of prejudice? That's arguable - clothing and manner of dress are used for a variety of reasons, but one being to signify a certain set of beliefs and values, an adherence to a certain social \"code\". \n\nThe fact is that inner city/ghetto culture in this country has rightfully earned a reputation for thuggish behavior. It isn't George Zimmerman's fault that if you open a hip-hop club in a city, even in a nice neighborhood, you have to pay for ten times more security and still deal with a higher frequency of fights and gang activity. That's just a fact, and we can either own up to it and figure out how to deal with it, or we can go off into some hippie-dippy la-la land of ignorant political correctness. It isn't a matter of skin color, it's a matter of cultural mores and values promulgated by different quarters of society. But it is an important matter that needs to be addressed: the epidemic of violence in the inner city is claiming a lot of lives, and costing a lot more their livelihoods. If we really care about our children and our countrymen, we will summon up the courage to stop looking for scapegoats and face up to this serious problem. Trayvon Martin, who by all accounts knocked a guy onto the ground and then continued beating him mercilessly, is a sad victim of this culture, as are *so many* young black men and women. Look at the homicide rates in Chicago, look at the faces of the victims. Look at the perpetrators... it's not a bunch of George Zimmermans.\n\nI feel tremendous sympathy for the kid's family. I feel tremendous sympathy for the kid himself... he could be so many kids I grew up with, called friend, ate dinner with. We've all made mistakes, and you and I, dear reader, are still here to talk about it, able to learn from them and carry on with our lives. Sadly, Trayvon isn't still with us, and will never have that opportunity to learn from mistakes. He didn't deserve that fate. \n\nBut the reality is that George Zimmerman is not ultimately to blame for his fate... George Zimmerman had no other choice, if we take a rational reading of events. Anyone who says they would passively lay there and let themselves be pinned to the ground and beaten into unconsciousness or worse on the street is either lying or hopelessly naive, and probably both. What's to blame for Trayvon's fate is a culture that teaches our young men that they are not men unless they solve their problems with violence, that respect is synonymous with beating people up, and using your words and your head instead of your fists is cowardly, and that running away from a meaningless confrontation is a shameful act rather than a wise one. It's a fate that will continue to befall an unfortunate number of us, and disproportionately those of us who are black or poor or from the 'hood, until we steel ourselves to confronting the real problem.",

I was standing to the outside of the crowd purposefully to avoid being in the pit, and was pushed into a pit by the people around me. I ended up fucking up my back and having issues walking for about a week afterwards. I did not volunteer to be in that pit, I did not stand too close to it for it to be my fault. Not everybody who finds themselves in a pit wants to be there. As well, when some asshole cold clocks you in the face (which happened to me in another pit) it stands to reason that you're going to be pissed. And I would imagine the majority of people you see whining or complaining fall into one of those two categories - over aggressive assholes pushing you into a pit, or over aggressive assholes hurting you on purpose in said pit.\n\nAnd to clarify, I have been in many pits willingly, and have enjoyed the majority of those occasions.

From the perspective of the characters, Arvo is a known liar, clearly hostile, has tried to escape, and has tried to have your group killed. It just doesn't make sense that so many of the characters go out of their way to help him. \n\nNevertheless, despite all the actions Arvo has taken against the group, they still try to help him. Arvo responds by shooting Clem. Now I think it's important to note that depending on your choices, at the time Clem was shot she would have been completely innocent.\n\nTaking my play through as an example:\n\n* Clem didn't steal from him\n* Clem didn't attack him\n* Clem had put her gun down when she was shot.\n\nArvo shot a little unarmed girl just because he was sad? Doesn't cut it for me.\nFirst off, I don't think we can overlook the fact that Lee was talking to an 8 year old. It seemed very obvious to me that he was sugar coating it a bit.\n\nRegardless, that isn't an excuse, and there are plenty of examples out there that show Arvo was a relatively bad person. \n\nChrista had more of a reason to blame Clem for Omid's death than Arvo had a reason to blame Clem for anything. She didn't take it out on her, or shoot her, she attempted to move and even took care of Clem.\nIt is implied that Lee's crime involved people really close to him, which led to a sense of betrayal and overreaction. It's definitely bad, but not the same as Arvo.\n\nWhat I think you are forgetting is that Arvo was a terrible person BEFORE all the bad stuff happened to him, and that he took out his anger on an innocent bystander.\n\nThe entire catalyst to his shitty situation was him putting Clem's group in mortal danger based on a lie.\n\nI'd even go one step further and say Kenny was right. It seemed really obvious that Arvo was going to try and kill someone. Had the group just been reasonable and listened to Kenny to begin with, then all the deaths in E5 could have been avoided.",
