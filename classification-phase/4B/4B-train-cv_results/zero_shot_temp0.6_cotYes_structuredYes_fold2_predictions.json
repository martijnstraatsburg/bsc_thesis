    "body": "I think the main reason they avoided that card is because they knew Zimmerman was not a racist.\nIt *is* hard to tell, sure.  We'll never know.  But in white+white cases, where a competent defence is presented regarding a self-defence claim of not guilty, you just don't see guilty. \n\nNothing about the event, about Martin's criminal history, or about the forensics suggests that Martin did not initiate an *apparently* violent attack against Zimmerman.\n\nWe know that:\n\n1. Both parties were on edge\n\n2. Martin had an opportunity to leave the scene, but did not (this piece may not have been related, but can be meaningful in aggregate)\n\n3. Martin had Zimmerman pinned to the ground with Zimmerman having a head wound at the time of the shooting.\n\nOf course, 3 is the big one unless someone has a *strong* argument that Zimmerman escalated physical assault.  An out-of-shape guy was in a position he probably could not escape from, having received the first of (what could have been many, or could not have been any more) wounds that would have a good chance of permanently injuring or killing him.\n\nThat's such an overwhelming amount of reasonable doubt that only a terrible defence couldn't get one person on a jury.  The police didn't seem to *want* to arrest, the DA didn't seem to *want* to prosecute.  There's a good reason.  They had to know the odds were slim and that they could not prosecute later if new evidence came out.  Nothing is worse than having your hand forced when you know that's the end of the game.\n\nI think you're focusing a lot on the unarmed 17 year old... a jury would be focused on the unarmed 17 year old on TOP of an out-of-shape old guy slamming his head in the ground... and then the judge would speak to them and tell them repeatedly about \"reasonable doubt\".  He would repeat \"reasonable doubt\" until the first reasonable doubt led people to go \"oh, shit...that's reasonable doubt\"\n\nA key part of your belief is that there were assumptions made of him being dangerous.  How could anyone portray anyone else on top of a guy slamming his head into the ground as NOT dangerous?  Further, while he did not have a criminal record, he would be extremely easy to paint as a criminal, from his violent/angry photographs to the *reasons* of his suspension from high school.  \n\nThen, look at stuff like this [picture](http://axiomamnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/martin-zimmerman-case-trayvons-body-crime-scene.png).  The jury did.  The jury also (presumably) heard that Martin bragged about being a repeat violent offender so much that his own mother thought he was arrested when he was 5-hours late from 7/11.\n\nIf you've got testimony that supports \"I beat the shit out of people who look at me wrong\" and suddenly that person is shot while on to of a wounded man with no violent history, and there are no good witnesses... if the story matches the forensics, and there's no compelling evidence, the guy walks.",

    "body": "People in the DC universe are absurdly resilent. Criminals are regularly thrown through windows and walls without any lasting harm. Ordinary civilians and bystanders can jump higher, run faster, and take more punishment than a normal human would be able to. For instance, Batman, an ordinary human at peak physical health, runs faster than Usain Bolt, regularly lifts more than the human world record, and recovers from injuries faster than should be humanly possible. The DC human brain is probably more shock-resistant than a normal human brain.\n\nIn Batman begins, Batman had every intention of having Gordon blow up the train tower which would cause the train to crash, and every intention of leaving Ra's al Ghul there to die. He said he wasn't killing him, he just wasn't saving him. That's just the same as Batman pulling the trigger on a gun and saying \"I am not killing you, the bullet is\". He made the plan, and executed it, knowing Ra's al Ghul would die.\n\nYou forget the point of Batman's no-kill rule. It isn't an arbitrary requirement he throws on himself for no reason. The no-kill rule is simply to hold himself back in the absence of public accountability, legal restrictions, or responsible partners (Robin is a kid. He doesn't count). When the cops fought Bane or when Gordon blew up the train tower, there were other people in the plot to ensure that Batman wasn't murdering out of petty revenge. The Batman can only kill out of absolute self-defense or under the eye of others to prevent himself from being the next Two-Face, Rorschach, or Ozymandias.",

It was no different. we had some \"space\" themed classes that some people just dicked their way through, some payed attention too and others just used the time to flirt and mock other members of the group.\n\nI don't know where you fit in your own schools clique circle. I don't know how you would have handled it, but i was a nerdy kid, not an ostracized one, and it was a waste of time and money.\n\nthe education was geared towards an average grade level of 9 or so (i was in 7th grade at the time, most of the people attending where about my age or older) the \"experience space training\" was basically rides we could only go on twice.\n\nthe gravity jumper, [was basically bungee cords](https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3415/3662223830_0b449f357c_z.jpg?zz=1)\n\n [the orbitron is something you can ride at most state fairs in texas](http://www.allaboutent.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/gyroscope-ride.jpg)\n\n the accelerator training was a [centrifugal force ride](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_64wjUxIOxTc/TNAuIK0CqZI/AAAAAAAAAUA/AjHjkse2HSI/s400/Carnival+Zero+Gravity+Centrifugal+Force+Full+Circle.png) except not as fun. \n\n\nwe met astronaughts and went to a space museum, they showed us a pee/human waste catcher and played a \"prank\" by asking us to examine it and rub it against our faces, touch and smell it before telling us it was used to catch poo and pee.\n\nobviously the cool kids used this to mock everyone else, even though we all did it\n\nwe were not aloud in the scuba tank, but watched actual astronought trainees in it, we ate space food (which sucked) for 10 days\n\nwhen i went home, i told my parents it was great.\n\neven as a child i felt it was a terrible waste of money and time.\n\n\n\nI feel the one in Florida at least was a money making opportunity, not something that would benefit the people attending. we were part of a group of 50 over 10 days or so. (maybe 7 days of camp) with a total of about 8 from my own school.\n\nwe spent a few days in a hotel resolt and mall, i spent that time in a nearby arcade with little supervision. I thought that was the best part of the whole thing. \n\n\nMaybe mine was particularly poorly run. I still have a coat and a badge from the experience. first hand, personal experience, it was a waste of effort and money and the more i think of it the more i am convinced the school got a kickback or something for organizing and trip to the camp.\n\ni believe mine took place in november, just as it was getting cold, so maybe we got the B team, maybe we were the B team. \n\n\n\ni don't know if this would convince you, but as i kid, before i begged and pleaded and gave up allowances for 2 months to prove i wanted to go. and i regretted it deeply after.\n\ni don't care anymore. but jeeez, what a goddam waste. \n\n\ntl:dr - waste of money, a camp with a few carnival rides that was less educational than any given math, science or skill specific camp. difference is the branding and the cost. there is no increase in value, only on cost. if this was a \"i should have gone to camp. maybe, but i should have gone to space camp. it has the same logo as my nasa camp did, i suspect it was the same thing.   no added value.",

Sure his life sucks but 1. he's free that means he's no longer a meth slave!!! and 2. he showed real agency rejecting Walter White's demands for perhaps the first time. \nthat's not what i took away from that speech. \"i did it for me\" is admitting he did it for himself, for the power, money, status, etc. He's confessing his sins and achieving a brief true reconcilliation. \nto be fair remember why Walter goes back. He doesn't go back to save Jessie, he goes back because he sees baby blue and thinks Jessie is working with the nazis. He has a change of heart only after he sees Jessie. Before he's going out in a blaze of glory motivated by his supervillian thoughts. \n\nAnyways Ozymandius king of kings look upon my works ye mighty and despair   was the \"real\" ending of Walter White supervillian. The last episodes see Walter as a broken man who sort of turned a corner. \n\n\nthat being said: it's clear God-showrunner granted him a \"perfect\" final couple of days and it's not clear how it makes sense that for instnace he gets into skylar's house without being detected. he gets more redemption than he deserves but the way i make sense of it is to think of it as the epilogue with ozymandius being the finale and it functions the same way the end and epilogue of say \"crime and punishment\" does.",
