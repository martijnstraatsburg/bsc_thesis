You are going to be running off of instinct, it's like how a drowning man will try to pull down someone who is trying to save him. Also, I've heard that since there aren't any certifications for martial arts, it's a big issue that there are scams which aren't really teaching anything useful but this was from a cracked article so take it with a grain of salt.\nWell the thing is, Trayvon probably wasn't but that doesn't mean Zimmerman is lying. He was placed in a high stress situation and it isn't unreasonable that he could have thought trayvon was reaching for his gun for whatever reason. In hindsight, this might not have been true but self-defense claims don't require him to have perfect knowledge of the situation.",

Then, the scuffle took place, but have you seen Zimmerman's face after the \"pummeling\"? No damage to his eyes, cheeks, fine a broken nose, but getting beaten to death? Nope, Zimmerman's lying about that. \n\nAlso, why should we simply believe that Zimmerman didn't START the fight? I love how people just simply assume Zimmerman's version was right, without questioning whether he shoved the teen (a violent act, but not one that would show in the autopsy). \n\nAlso, if he's getting beaten to death, he shoots a perfect shot to the chest, WITH someone on top of him waling on him with deadly punches??\n\nAs for the following, there's a conservative, a respected one who agrees with me.\n\nConservative intellectual George will echoed the same sentiment:\n\n\"Mr. Zimmerman says he was acting under this self-defense law, but he is said to have been recorded saying he pursued the person. You cannot be in pursuit and acting in self-defense.”\nhttp://www.mediaite.com/tv/george-will-on-trayvon-martin-stand-your-ground-law-is-a-bad-idea/\n\nFinally, if I'm armed, and this is just me, but I'm going to make sure that I'm a distance from a potential threat, so that I can draw the weapon. I'm not getting inches away from someone who could hurt me, or prevent me from grabbing the gun. But then again, that's me, obviously Zimmerman \"somehow\" knew, without warning the kid that he was armed, that he'd be able to both confront the potential \"perp\" in close proximity, possibly get into a fight, but also miraculously pull his gun out without a problem.",

    "body": "Korra had many disadvantages too. I don't agree that age and experience gave Korra a significant advantage because Aang traveled around the world and had more \"real life\" experience. Korra was confined to the Southern Water Tribe and had her teachers shipped to her while she didn't know very much about the outside world. Aang was fairly spiritual and able to easily get into the Spirit World while it took Korra most of the first two books to get to that point. \n\nI don't discount the struggle, but Aang certainly made things worse for himself. He would have had an easier time had he not gone into stasis. Assuming that he would be able to fend off the attackers at the Air Temples, the Water Tribes and the Earth Kingdom were not withered by the Hundred Year War. The Fire Nation had nowhere near the foothold on a global scale as they had a hundred years later so it would be easier for Aang to bid his time and train. Compare the \"final showdowns\": the very elderly Sozin with no combat skills other than bending and his successor who was just a baby, versus Ozai in his prime and his prodigy heiress who was literally one of the best benders in the world. There would also be a larger number of firebenders more sympathetic to the Avatar willing to teach him; he has friends in the Fire Nation. Basically, his potential allies would have been stronger before his stasis than after. \n\nI strongly disagree that his gang was ineffective. Team Avatar 1 literally taught Aang the other elements. Katara taught Aang after she surpassed his skill in the NWT and Pakku had nothing else to teach her, Toph taught him earthbending, Zuko mentored him in firebending. I can hardly call them ineffective when they taught Aang. Meanwhile, comic relief Bolin and angst Mako....yuck. They couldn't even hold off Desna and Eska at the spirit portals. \n\nLastly, I argue that Aang soldiered on because he felt that he had no other choice, but not because he truly wanted to.",

    "body": "But that's precisely the point.  The difference in age of someone, say, 45 versus someone who is 49 is not going to be as vast as the difference between someone 12 and 16.  Both are 4 year age gaps, but the contrast is much sharper for the lower age pair.  Most people wouldn't bat an eye at, say, the 45 year old and the 49 year old getting into a relationship, but a 12 and a 16 year old in a relationship would be considered odd/wrong/etc.  Why?  Because a dearth in years means a lot more at that age.\n\nIt's not to say a 16 is fully mature, or isn't changing, or has nothing left to learn.  Far from it.  It just that it's even more amplified for someone even younger.  The average 16 year old would be much more mentally equipped to handle the stress and pressure of having to save the world than a 12 year old.  \nSure -- to a point.  If, say, one of your parents pass away when you are 12, it can certainly cause you to \"grow up\" faster, but it doesn't mean you're suddenly as mature as an adult.  Indeed, kids growing up in a wartime situation are probably going to be a bit more mature than similarly aged peace time kids, but they aren't adults by any stretch of the imagination. \n\nAt the same time, kids say some poignant things from time to time, and if a kid was raised by monks I'm sure their outlook would be heavily influenced by that.  Further, he is the reincarnation of the avatar.  He has no shortage of experience to draw from, and I don't think it always has to be in some dramatic fashion when he does so.  \n\nBasically, I don't really see any major plot holes/issues by having kids that understand the urgency of an important mission but still fall prey to the inexperience of their years.  I mean, like, watch a TED talk of some 14 year old trying to do something crazy/cool like provide cheap/clean water for people in Africa.  On one hand they certainly understand the gravitas of the water situation, want to help out, etc.  On the other hand, watching them present their findings/research/product clearly shows that at the end of the day they are still a young (or relatively young) child.  I don't see cognitive dissonance when I watch TLA because I know that kids *can* be simultaneously mature and immature.  \nI disagree.  Toph was very clearly demonstrated as having a rough and tumble demeanor, and yet was still sensitive and kind underneath.  Kids show writing aside, I don't believe Toph would be capable of killing someone in cold blood -- not at the age of 12 anyway.  \n\nI like Korra and the series, but I think TLA was better written.  If I had to take a stab at explaining why I think that, its that I felt TLA was more free to explore the world of Avatar, while LOK is confined to certain parameters set forth by TLA.  To me it's like the same reason fan fiction is never really as good as the original.  It doesn't mean none of it is enjoyable, but they are writing essentially a derivative work that has to fit in the confines of the existing world.  I'm sure they can certainly take some liberties, but the pioneering is largely done.  \n\nFor a more explicit example, take Harry Potter.  I'm guessing there's a good chance you've read them.  But in any event, while subsequent works can certainly be enjoyable and fun to read, any author (including Rowling herself) is bound by the original rules of the original series.  Any written work in that universe cannot (figuratively) be allowed to negate or trivialize previous struggles by inventing new stuff.  That is, if some later work introduced a new spell that would have trivialized Harry's struggles in the original 7 books, that's going to be *really* bad writing.\n\nThe same applies to LOK in my mind.  Not that it's written poorly, but now that TLA is canon, the writers have to be careful not to override anything (at least not without significant explanation/retconning).",

The most compelling part of your argument is that 12 year olds can still say wise things, but you still cannot expect them to have the same moral agency as an adult even if they do act more mature than their age and participate in war. It's why juveniles and adults are not tried in the same courts in the real world. There are a few things here and there I don't agree with but they do not affect the integrity of your argument. I still have a personal preference for Korra the Avatar though :)\n\nNo, never really got into Harry Potter, I've only read the first and part of the fifth book and watched the first and fourth movies.",

    "body": "ooooooh interesting question. I felt like I had a lot of crushes when I was a kid. I did the same things--the acting strangely, the telling good friends I had a crush on x, etc etc etc. I also remember obsessing about the crush object and imagining out all sorts of weird narrative scenarios where I have to rescue them or we both realize we're in love through some improbable situation. Strangely at the time it felt a lot like a medieval courtly love, like abelard and heloise--a feeling of intense devotion and obsession, the sense that material signs of love like kissing or dates would \"ruin\" it. So in that sense I agree with you, I think. I even worked up the nerve to tell one girl I liked her in 7th grade, after spending months building up to it, and when I finally did she said \"yeah, I know\" and my mind went blank and I had literally NO IDEA what to do next. Nothing happened and we continued being normal friends. \n\nBut even now (I'm 25 now) and I can get sort of obsessive about certain girls in the same way--just idealizing them and thinking about how great they are all the time and how they complete me. It's a mode of attraction which makes for a lot of unrequited love and, also, makes me act like an ass. This happens ESPECIALLY if I wait a really long time to make a move on someone I like. The way I see it, a crush is like an investment of hope. You dump some imagination into what it would like to be with that person, and then that image feeds you a certain shining. Even though it can slow action, because the reality of what that idealized person actually IS breaks through the illusion which sustains you for so long. ANYWAYS this is all to say while you're right that children don't have any sexual component to their crushes, the fantasy and imagination to evoke romantic feelings can still work. Kids develop those kinds of feelings early on through parental behavior, through culture, etc etc etc. What do you think?",

After looking at the conclusions reached by the Warren Commission, I was somewhat skeptical of the notion that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, but the HSCA report clarifies some of the issues surrounding the timing and circumstances of the assassination, and leaves open the idea that Oswald may have had a partner. Additionally, I do feel that the events following the assassination are slightly suspicious (notably LBJ appointing and overseeing the Warren Commission), but are not at present sufficient for me to discount the accepted explanation of the assassination.  The number of conspiracy or alternate theories surrounding the assassination is prodigious and confusing, to say the least, but I am willing to accept an alternate theory and CMV if someone can present a compelling alternate explanation of the JFK assassination supported by clear and provable facts.",
