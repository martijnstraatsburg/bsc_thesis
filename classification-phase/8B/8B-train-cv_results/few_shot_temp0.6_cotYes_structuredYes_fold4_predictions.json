    "body": "You probably have a point in that they look quite similar, at least as much as a white Englishman and a small Japanese lady can look alike, but I think you've misunderstood the nature of their relationship. She came in to his life at a time when he was experimenting heavily with LSD, a drug which he has stated killed his ego completely. He was extremely dissatisfied with his involvement with the Beatles and the fame that it had brought him. When he first met Yoko, she didn't give a shit who he was. Can you imagine the allure of a woman who couldn't care less about your fame after years of being chased by screaming girls every time you set foot in public?\n\nI think you'll find also that they were extremely aligned in their philosophical and political beliefs, which was the bedrock of their relationship really. Also, from 1975-1980 he virtually withdrew completely from the public eye to be with his family. People with trophy wives (which is essentially what you are equating Yoko to) simply don't do that.",

They generally hate themselves already for being such a burden, and don't want mom to walk into the bedroom with brains splattered all over the walls. Pills are among the cleanest suicide methods. \n\n3 - knowledge\n\nOverdosing on pills is HARD to do well. You don't need a controlled substance - lots of over the counter meds will do it. \n\nYou had this friend in high school who tried it previously, that means he was probably 16 at most when it happened. He likely had no idea what he was taking, or how much would be required to kill him.\n\n4 - pain\n\nJust because I'm dying doesn't mean I'm not going to feel it.\n\nAlso, dying from a pill OD takes a long time. You could easily pass out hours before you die, thus dramatically increasing the chances you are discovered. \n\n[Pill OD is actually the most common form of suicide among doctors (the profession with the most suicide), who, not surprisingly, have resounding success.](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-narcissus-in-all-us/200908/the-occupation-the-highest-suicide-rate)",

In fact GZs friend (Taffy) that is on CNN every night used this same argument. In addition its the similar to what GZ defense is using in that he felt the beating he was taking was life threatening. We know now that his injuries were nowhere close to being life threatening. But what we do know that GZ knew is that police were on their way and people were around, I will admit that is unfair for me to say that as I wasn't the one that got punched, hindsight is 20/20. \n\nFor me it comes down to George Zimmerman is an **adult and trained neighborhood watchman**. GZ knew TM was a kid. At some point he should have identified who he was as he had plenty of opportunity. He should have never left his car, IMO he left his car to catch TM, there was no other reason for him to leave his car in the rain. He needs to be punished for his incompetence. \nPlease don't assume you know what I base my position on, I very mixed emotions on the entire thing and have gone back and forth on my position. And how the media spun it had really no affect on me. One guy is dead and the other guy life is probably ruined. Both could have and should have made better decisions, however one was an adult, the other was a kid. \n\nYou should really refrain from calling TM a thug, racist, street fighter, drug dealer etc..

When the cameras are watching, you don't bend rules... and the rules actually favor the defendant heavily. (better 10 guilty free than 1 innocent jailed).  \n\nIf Martin was white, the media probably wouldn't have been around (hillarious, because there's so much evidence and so many arguments that this was NOT a race-related crime.. unless you say that Martin's initiation was due to his racism against Zimmerman the \"creepy-ass cracker\" (his words).\nOf course it is... but Zimmerman's story fit the evidence... which suggested Zimmerman was on the ground on his back, firing at point blank range at Martin above him.  That alone reeks of reasonable doubt.  No media cameras and a shitty lawyer? Might not have won a case, but that would be a failure of Justice.\nAn armed adult who he had tackled, and who had just hit his head on concrete from the conflict.

The tension of a female prisoner on a world of celibate men is also great.\n\nHowever, the following things are really annoying:\n\n- In the first movie, there was one alien. In Aliens, there were a ton of aliens, making the adversary even more terrifying. However, in the third movie, they are back to one alien. So, how do they up the terror factor in a world with one alien? See next point.\n\n- No weapons. The only way to create tension with only one alien is to have a world with no weapons. Are you kidding me? Now, Alien and Aliens are still great horror/sci-fi movies without the action, but the whole \"don't shoot them, they bleed acid\" and \"you need a flamethrower\" themes have completely been thrown out. They are completely defenseless, and the lack of any firearm action really takes away from the movie.\n\n- The fact that the alien they are fighting used a dog as a host. Thus, it takes on traits of the dog, looks like a dog, etc. Apparently, this is why the aliens in the first two movies look like they do; they used humans as hosts. Apparently, this is a mythology point with the alien franchise. BUT IT IS NEVER EXPLAINED. The alien also looks very different from what we expect, but they never explain why.\n\n- The fucking 1st person camera angles. Oh my God. Because they can't have multiple alien kills or any kind of firearm violence, they attempt to up the scares with first person shots of the alien chasing people. We know you are going to die, just die already!",

    "body": "Since the original text is deleted, here's the text form the original post:\n\nThrowaway account. \n\nFirst of all, I am a 24 year old male, engaged to my girlfriend (now fiance) of 6 years. We are in a great place and are getting married in October. \n\nLast night I went to my best friend's birthday party. My fiance is out of town til Tuesday. I arrived around 1030pm after pre-gaming with two other friends, so when I arrived I was pretty sloshed. I remember arriving. \n\nI also remember running into a girl, we'll call Mandy, I had known in high school. We had dated briefly and she was my first blowjob back then. Anyway. We caught up and all that, and I remember her being particularly flirty. I told her I was engaged and even showed her pictures of my fiance. Then, I went about my night. I remember my best friend pulling me aside and told me that Mandy was wanting to hook up with me, and was overly flirty. I was honestly pretty oblivious of her advances. \n\nAnyway, I kept drinking. Took several shots of Southern Comfort, and eventually blacked out. The only thing I remember after that is a quick flash of me vomiting out in the back yard. But something else happened. \n\nMy best friend said he walked upstairs to grab a towel, because someone had thrown up in his kitchen. When he opened the door, apparently Mandy was giving me a blowjob. I was apparently just lying there, looked like I was asleep. In his drunken state, he didn't think much of it, so he shut the door. \n\nI woke up the next morning around 7am, alone. My pants were completely off, and I still had my shirt on. I found out later from my best friend he overheard Mandy on her way out telling someone we had sex. I was completely blacked out, probably even passed out. I was definitely raped.\n\nI don't know what to tell my fiance. I'm trying to keep it under wraps. I'm afraid she won't believe I was raped. What do I do?\n\n**TL;DR** I was raped by an old flame at my friend's party. I have a fiance and I'm afraid of telling her in fear she won't believe me.\n\nEdit 1: Just called my fiance, told her I had something I wanted to talk to her about and not to worry. I just didn't want to pretend everything was normal til Tuesday. She is coming home early and will be back tomorrow evening. I've worried her, and now I'm even more afraid to tell her...\n\nEdit 2: Thank you everyone for your support. I'm still incredibly worried about telling my fiance. But it's gotta happen. I will post an update tomorrow night if I can. Honestly, I'm more worried about losing my love than I am hurt that it happened. I don't think I will need counseling, I'm a pretty level headed and rational person. NOT that people who do need counseling aren't! Just for me, personally, I don't think it would help much. Just a personal preference. Everybody copes differently. \n\nEdit 3: I just talk to my best friend. We both agree, it definitely appears I was raped. He says the more he think about it, the more he thought I was asleep or passed out when she was blowing me. He apologized for not stopping it, but was so drunk he just didn't think anything of it. He's willing to talk to my fiance is she needs proof. Also he is going to try and talk to Mandy soon. He's just thinking of a way to do it tactfully. I will also update with how that goes.\n\n[Source](http://np.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/2423ao/i_was_raped_last_night_im_engaged_im_a_man/)",

Therefore, he is not responsible.

    "body": "The title of your post made me think that you wanted convincing that mentally ill or depressed people killing themselves counts as suicide and shouldn't deserve pity. However, I'll add in a point of view that shows that others are responsible or at least complicit in aiding the death of Kurt Cobain.\n\nDepression or drug use:\n\nIf an old person is at the top of a set of stairs walking down and her leg or hip breaks due to calcium deficiency. Because of this, she falls down the stairs and dies from the injuries. One would not say that the old person committed suicide. Blaming the death on the fall also not precise. It was the injury that should be blamed much as if another person pushed her down the stairs would be blamed.\n\nNow, instead of an old person its a person with depression. They're at the top of the stairs looking down and their mind breaks too much at that moment and they toss themselves forward. The injuries from the fall leads to his death. Do you blame the person, the fall or the mental injury?\n\nIt's the above reasons that insurance companies pay out for suicide so long as the policy is two years or older. We assume that taking out a policy just prior to suicide makes the act a conscious thought with hopes that the death leads to a cash reward to others. However, suicide as a result of mental illness is not considered a rational choice and death from that is considered as much an accident as falling down the stairs due to a physical injury. \n\nConsidering the above, you could say that killing one's self due to depression is not suicide but death due to illness. As such, given the evidence with Kurt Cobain, he did not commit suicide.\n\nEnabling:\n\nIf a person is depressed and taking illicit drugs and alcohol that exacerbates the problem, it can be deadly. Now, what about the people that know about that person's issues and callously ignores them and even offers to provide substances or enables the destructive behavior? I would argue that falls under reckless endangerment, and given the mental illness factor could be criminal in nature. \n\nWhile Courtney loved Kurt (actually, I don't know, but let's just assume so), her lifestyle continued to pull Kurt further and further down till his mind snapped to the point that he killed himself. She was the one that provided the push, and if she was not mentally ill herself can be responsible for the death of Kurt.\n\nConspiracy:\n\nNot touching that path.",

I'm not sure I can call it a field trip because I'm from Indiana and we went over the weekend. The group of students who went were people who wanted to go so it wasn't for a class. On the trip we buddied up with someone else and that person ended up being a good friend of mine throughout high school and I still keep in touch with him (I am one year out of college). \n\nHaving said all of that can you say that your trip would have ended up the same way or better? My enjoyment was due to the school trip and buddy system that was complete luck in it's pairing of myself and my friend. I also only remember two things about the entire weekend trip, which probably totals 20 minutes. My area of study and my career do not reflect an early interest in space or rocketry. Considering all of this, it is a nice memory but I cannot say my life is enriched by the experience. I have an interest in space now but that comes from other areas such as Neil Tyson, sci fi movies, and recent scientific events.\n\nI'm not saying it sucked back then like you want me to say but apparently it wasn't that great because I don't remember all that much about it. If your interest in science is making you reflect and wish that you went (you don't really give a reason), there are ways to get similar effects. Go to the National Air and Space museum in D.C. and watch an educational film in iMAX and there's most of Space Camp right there.",

    "body": "I suggest checking out the official patriots [rebuttal](http://wellsreportcontext.com/) to the Wells Report\nThere was  national media uproar about potentially deflated game balls.  If you were one of only a handful of locker room attendants who handled the balls, of course you would be interested if your name came up.  What kind of asshole would *not* tell his friend that his name came up in an interview with security. \nBrady knew he liked his balls at 12.5 psi.  He requested the locker room guys hand the refs a highlighted copy of the rule book so they knew what range it could be.  That requires inflating (and if necessary deflating if they've been over-inflated) the balls.  Needles are required for both inflating and deflating.\nThey claim they were referencing him trying to sell his game tickets.  But they claim the \"he\" that starts that quote wasn't referring to Brady.  It's one of the sketchier parts but is far from conclusive.\nThis was the week after the referees in a Jets game inflated the Patriots balls to 16 PSI, well over the legal limit.  Given that they were being yelled at for over-inflating the balls, discussing deflating would make sense.\nThis was in May 2014.  If they were deflating balls all the way back to the 2013-2014 season, then how did they end up getting surprised by 16psi balls during the Jets game in the 2014-2015 season?  They say it was a reference to losing weight.  The bit about ESPN was preceded by a discussion of getting free sneakers, which they were not allowed to do.  \nI would hope that Tom Brady and every major NFL star gives out signs gear for free for the lower-level team employees.  And, importantly, the Wells Report made no attempt to show that this was at all unusual for the Patriots or for NFL teams in general.\nYeah, guys whose job it is to inflate the balls need needles to work the pumps.  The request for cash clearly sounds like a joke, especially in the context of the rest of their text message jokes. \nAgain, players sign all kinds of stuff, I don't see any reason to suggest this was some kind of quid pro quo.  Unless you hear players or employees saying that it's rare for players to sign all kinds of stuff and give away used equipment, I don't think this is any evidence of anything.  And these were the guys who prepared his game balls.  It's important to keep those guys happy.  \nOk, admittedly destroying the phone was a bad idea, but: A) At that point, he wasn't going to give it to them anyway, so destroying didn't do anything to cover up actions. B) If Brady's lawyer were the one selecting which messages were relevant, then I don't really see how they were expecting to get any incriminating evidence of the phone anyway.  C) I think his claim that he didn't want to set a precedent of players having to turn over private cell phones or private text conversations is legit. D) Around the time of the appeal (although a bit too little, too late) he pulled the records of his text messages and said he was willing to attempt to recover the contents from the other peoples' phones.\nThe AFC championship game was unusual in the sense that it was delayed due to the late ending of the NFC championship game.  As a result the pregame timing was a little different, and the Officials Locker Room was crowded with people watching the end of the other game.",

    "body": "The patent system as a whole is good (including software patents). The only problems with the patent office today is that it grants patents that are later found to be invalid, and that some patents last too long. CMV\n\nThis post will focus on software patents since that is what I am most familiar with.\n\nI think that the patent system should serve two purposes: rewarding effort, and providing incentives for innovation, and that it currently does that. Some of the problems people often bring up in the current system are:\n\nPatents are granted for things that are too easy to create: I think that the expiration date for a patent should be set by the examiner and should be dependent on the investment that went into developing the technology. Drug patents that require billions of dollars of research can continue to have long terms. Software patents that require half a year of research by a few people will have shorter terms. This is not a major overhaul of the system, and supports the goal of providing incentives for innovation by forcing companies to continue to innovate if they want to have exclusive access to technology (and all the financial benefits that gives).\n\nPatents are granted for things that have already been invented: These patents should not be granted. This is not a change to the current system.\n\nPatent trolls are a thing: If the patents being used to 'troll' are legitimate, I think this is not a problem, due to the goal of rewarding effort. I think that a person who is a skilled inventor but unskilled at manufacturing, distribution, marketing, or all the other things necessary to make money from an invention should still be rewarded for his invention, by selling the right to use his invention to other companies. Or, he should be able to outsource the selling part to people who are good at that, while he continues doing what he is good at, which is inventing.\n\nPatents are granted on math: Allowing patents on math helps provide both stated goals of the patents system.

    "body": "I believe having the \"over\" orientation of toilet paper is the only correct way to have the roll placed. CMV.\n\nWhen I say over, I mean the new roll comes out in front like [this](http://imgur.com/kCiVqkc) as opposed to the [under](http://imgur.com/A3jzMiV) orientation.\n\nIt is so much easier to pull down more squares with the roll coming over. Every time I come across an under roll, I usually end up have to do a complete 360 until I can find the start. Not only does this waste time, it just seems unhygienic to have to touch the whole roll, or have to reach around just to grab hold of it. I used to think people were just lazy when loading a new roll and didn't look at the orientation, but the other day I heard someone say they always place the roll the other way. \n\nCan someone who prefers their toilet roll in the \"under\" orientation please explain the appeal and convince me that the \"over\" way is wrong?",

    "body": "I thought Alien 3 was a good sequel. CMV\n\nI'll try and justify it with these reasons (which also stop many of the arguments I usually hear against it)\n\n* The soundtrack was just amazing, the slow paces for moving scenes and the impending crescendo for when Weyland Yutani arrives was some of the best I've ever heard (Eg, [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ckg2RaCpTI#t=158))\n\n* The death of Newt and Hicks... boy oh boy is this a tough one to defend. Although it makes Aliens seem pointless, an earlier draft of the script shed some good light on it: Newt was going to be a host to an alien, and would have died in either agony of her chest exploding or her surroundings exploding - instead her last memories and feelings were safety and security in the Sulaco, and she would've died in peace. The same can be said for Hicks. From a practical standpoint, it also helped move the script along - if they had both survived, how many other ways could a potential sequel 'end' without Ripley saving Newt? It also fits the Alien franchise rather well - the Xenomorphs being without conscience or remorse, taking away everything. \n\n* It was the most original of the Alien movies. Out of the 4 sequels, how many ended with Ripley blasting the last Alien out of a spaceship? The first, second, and fourth (If you'd call that a xeno) Rather than copy the first two films, it went down a different direction with a dark prison-y environment. A bald Ripley certainly made for a different change (Her hair is almost a metaphor, long for innocence in Alien, short for anxiety and confidence in Aliens and no more for Alien^3 , showing she had lost it all and accepted it), this one brought closure for Ripley. \n\n* She was finishing off the Xeno's by killing herself and spiting the company that made her lose everything trying to get it, the most sensible and plausible ending in a universe like this\n\n* The cast was great. From everyday truckers to cocky marines, a British cast of prisoners was a great idea for the next installment. ~~Tywin Lanister~~ Charles Dance made an excellent addition to cast as well as Charles Dutton, along with other heavyweights like Pete Postlethwaite in the mix. The funeral scene was the most poignant moment in the whole series IMO.\n\n* The sets and backgrounds looked great, despite the actual alien. Yes I will admit the Alien looked very CGI (although it was a puppet added over the film), the brooding planet and almost goth-like prison halls were a nice theme and very fitting for a murky alien.\n\n* The alien itself made for a smart change too. From a general soldier to a Queen, the 'runner' or dog/ox-alien was an interesting take on it. (And would also become cannon regarding aliens taking on their hosts form for the expanded universe)\n\n* One of the most important things I noted about it was the genuine reactions people have to it. When watching Alien people would exclaim \"Man I'd *shit* my pants in that situation\" or in Aliens they would cry \"WHOO GAME OVER MAN BREAK OUT THE BIG GUNS\" but would react exactly as intended to Alien^3 like they were in the movie. \n* As for the plothole about the eggs on the Sulaco, I think the Queen in extenuating circumstances would lay a few eggs as an emergency safeguard for the population. One would certainly be a Queen with a few others to guard it. These eggs did not have time to mature like the ones in the Queen Sack (ick) So after a while in the landing gear on the dropship, these eggs may be wired to actively search nearby hosts due to the urgency. *OR* they may have been moved by an automated system on the Sulaco to move organic material, even the possibility the company intended this from long distance.\n\n* Although the first two movies are fantastic, they could be a little bit limited at times - if you step back to look at it, the ending of Aliens with Ripley fighting off a Queen with a free tail and arms should be impossible, but was overlooked cause she was being a hero. In this movie she was a lot more human.\n\n* Not necessarily horror or action, I think this is almost borderline Sci-Fi Drama\n\nAll in all I thought it was a worthy sequel to the first two and concluded the series nicely. Alien Resurrection was a bit meh, no where near the same par.",
