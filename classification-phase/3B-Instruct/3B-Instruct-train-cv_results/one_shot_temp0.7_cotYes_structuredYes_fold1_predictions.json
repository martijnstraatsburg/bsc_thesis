    "body": "Yeah, you are definitely right. They do look remarkably similar. I think John does look fairly unusual for an Englishman as he does have a quite flat nose and narrow eyes. \n\nWhile it looks like some of the pictures in your links may be from his retirement period (most notably the one where he is naked and cradling up to Yoko), a majority of them are between 1968 and I'd say around '74 as that is when the pair of them were most active, both in music and activism. Mind you, John did re-enter the music business shortly before his death in 1980 so there are a few shots in there that can throw you off. You can usually tell though because they have both aged significantly, as can be seen in [this shot](http://i.imgur.com/P6ltXc8.jpg).\n\nCheers for my first delta, glad I could help shed some light on it.",

    "body": "I somewhat agree but I'm going to take a shot anyways. Perhaps I can get you to share in my ambivalence.\n\nFirst some background stuff: There are a lot of misconceptions surrounding tort law (the law of civil liability) and I want to clear up some of the more common ones. (This would be a fruitless endeavor if we weren't starting on the same page.) Am I safe in assuming that:\n\n1. You are not a lawyer, and\n2. Your idea of what liability of law is comes from the waivers we have to sign when we go Scuba diving, parachuting, and mountain climbing?\n\nMany of the provisions under those disclaimers are for CYA purposes only. Chances are, if someone tried to sue for most of the things covered under such a waiver they wouldn't win anyways, the cost of adding in such a provision is so cheap (the cost of a few extra peices of paper and ink) that companies feel its worthwhile to do so, in case they get an irrational jury or something. \n\nThe effect of this is that the boundaries of what might actually create liability are actually far, far narrower than what you might think just from reading the waivers. \n\n\nThat being said: I would challenge the idea that possibility of civil remedy promotes poor decision-making on two ground.\n\n********\n\nFirst -- I would challenge the idea that possibility of civil remedy promotes poor decision-making with the fact that in all jurisdictions I know of, the defendant in a lawsuit for negligence has the defense of **comparative negligence**. \n\nThat is to say, if the defendant can show that the plaintiff was negligent and that contributed to his injury, the defendant may be relieved of some or all of his liability, depending on the degree of the plaintiff's negligence compared to that of the defendant.\n\nMany states have the rule where if the plaintiff was even one iota negligent, the defendant is completely relieved of ANY liability regardless of how negligent he was. This is called **contributory negligence** and it's a little more controversial. (For the reasons you mention, I am ambivalent as to which is the better rule.)\n\nPart two incoming (because apparently people are getting impatient).",

    "body": "Depression as a mood and depression as a mood disorder are two different things. Many people experience periods of transient depression. This is not a disorder, but it still can be quite severe and result in self-harm or suicide. Depression as a mood disorder is persistent, and in many cases lifelong, feelings of being \"down\", inadequate, worthless, suicidal, and just generally dissatisfied with life. \nThese may be people who are experiencing transient periods of depression, these may be liars, or they may be people covering up their depression. Speaking for myself as someone who has an anxiety disorder that causes persistent depression, I was known to be quite a boisterous, friendly and upbeat person in college. Many times I was the life of a party and I had a very large group of friends among whom I was known for being excitable and happy. Then I would go to my dorm room and cry or cut myself. Neither of those things was fake either. My friends genuinely made me happy, and why would I want to bring out my depression into a situation in which I was happy? Why would I want to deliberately bring myself and others down? On top of this, I would occasionally experience manic episodes. Mania is the other pole from which bipolar disorder gets its name. Whereas depression is characterized by a lack of energy and feelings of apathy or hopelessness, mania is characterized by an overwhelming intensity of energy that can result in anxiousness and panic, often resulting in that hair-trigger anger that people imagine when they think of BPD, or if you're lucky and spending time with people you like that mania can result in a high-energy euphoria that is actually one of the best feelings I have ever experienced. One of the things that bummed me out the most when I went on medication was knowing that these euphoric episodes would go away.\n\nAnyways, hope that helped some.",

Your Boo-Bear, for whatever reason, thinks that he wants a sphynx cat.  While your statement above is unclear, I am going to assume that he has experience with cats as well.  Now I would recommend that you ask him why he wants this particular type, and what he thinks of the cuddly issue.  But, remember that there is always the added benefit of, as long as you talk about it and do it together, making your Boo-Bear happy.  I'm not saying go along with it just because he wants to, but try to understand why he wants to, and realize that this is a decision you are making together, which really adds to the relationship.\n\n2)  Holy shit that cat is sa-weeeeet!  First off, its distinct!  Your friends will be like \"woah! that's the coolest cat ever! So unique!\"  It stands up proud like its not gonna take shit from nobody!  Also, its basically a God!  The Egyptians worshipped em, its even named for a mythical creature of incredible intelligence.  Hell, the Egyptians were so terrified of those things that during the Battle of Pelusium, the Persian Cambyses II released hundreds of 'em and the Egyptian refused to fight, lest they harm their Cat-God.  Persians killed em where they stood! That cat helped conquer nations, can a tabby say that?\n\n2) Now its disputed but they may be better for people with allergies.  See they don't have fur, and people are allergic to chemicals in cat dander, which is spread all over by the fur, when they're petter or whatever.  But this ain't got none of those little allergy missiles!  So while the allergy problem isn't TOTALLY gone, it is reduced.  Now you can make friends with the lesser-folk!\n\n3)  ANYTHING can be cuddly!  My friend has porcupine he carries everywhere!  His roommate sleeps with his snake wrapped all around him!  He even just got a badass tarantula that sits on his shoulder!  See, you just need to appreciate your pet, and to accept it for what it has to offer!  Look here: http://imgur.com/a/Qsrl3\nSee, \"cuddly\" is a frame of mind!\n\nDisclaimer:  I am by no means an expert on cats or any other living organism for that matter.  Please consult the breeder, veterinarians, etc., for the REAL advice.\n\nI hope this helps!",

If I thought I was being chased by someone who might hurt me, I'd be behind a locked door and calling the cops in under a minute.\n\nZimmerman did not, at the time, think that Martin was attacking him.  He thought he found the burglar, whose reactions, including the first flight, fit the expected profile of a criminal caught red handed.  Assuming Zimmeran's story was true (we just don't know), that makes Martin the one who initiated the physical conflict that led to Zimmerman fearing for his life and shooting Martin.\n\nFrom common sense and forensics point of view, there are more unknowns that work in Zimmerman's favor than Martin's.  Martin is terrified and running away, but chooses not to move to safety.  Why?\n\nZimmerman somehow ended up on his back with a wounded head before shooting Martin (who was directly on top of him).  How?\n\nEven their attitudes.  Zimmerman was don't-let-him-escape angry, while Martin seemed \"do anything to survive\" scared...

    "body": "Dexter season eight is awful.  It is so bad, that if there were a real life Dexter his first priority would be murdering everyone responsible for the travesty of season eight.  And I weep daily that there is not a real life Dexter.\n\nI am going to mention some events from the season.  I'm not calling these \"spoilers\" because that would imply that there was something to spoil.  Instead, I'm calling these \"saviors\" because I hope it ruins the plot and saves someone else from wasting their time with this idiotic show.\n\nLets start with what a good show is.  Dexter is a \"Dark Drama\" - and what I expect from this kind of show is, in a metaphor, a killer whale.  The whale is sleek and smooth in the same way that the show should be viscerally.  The whale is dangerous and the show should take risks and push boundaries.  The whale is subtle, a four and a half ton animal swimming at thirty miles an hour under the calm surface of the water - until the whale decides to let you see his dorsal.\n\nThe archetypal scene of season eight, was the one with Hanna McKay and that private detective on the bus.  Hanna injects the detective and tells him \"I've just given you a sedative, you'll wake up in a couple hours\".  Why did she say this?  I'll go through a few possible reasons.\n\n1. The character would have?  No.  Absolutely not.  Hanna is a subtle poisoner.  Announcing on a crowded bus, and in the company of a child, that you have just poisoned someone is not only reckless and idiotic (we know how this poison works, the guy is already zonked out, she is explaining to no one), but it is also anathema to her character.  She would want to keep things quiet and secret.\n\n2. The viewer needed the exposistion?  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Someone entirely unfamiliar with the series, watching that clip on mute would have been able to tell the relevant details.  She injects the guy, he passes out, she escapes.  Yup.  Plus, the Dexter viewer is intimately familiar with how this poison works.\n\n3. The show wants to make it painfully clear that Hanna (despite being a serial killer) isn't killing the guy now that she is a love interest.  Sadly, this is the correct answer.\n\nAt this point, the show has been neutered.  Any kind of danger or risk taking in terms of plotting elements is gone.  Hanna is the good person now, only doing good things.  She would never kill anyone and the show will use retard gloves to pointless drive that into you.\n\nContrast this with the scene in Breaking Bad were Lydia comments that there is only a single packet of Stevia remaining.  This scene feels like the lurch of an unexplained ripple beneath your life raft in the midst of still waters.  Dexter season eight is like they ranked all the Dexter fanfiction that existed and then decided to film one, but they accidentally chose from the bottom of the list instead of the top.\n\nWhere once the show was clever, it became bumbling and hamfisted.  Dexter can't do anything right.  Constantly failing to kill people he should, making mistakes, never learning from his actions.  Oh, taking this boy murderer under your wing now buddy?  HOW MANY FUCKING TIMES HAS THAT FAILED FOR YOU BY NOW?  Wants to kill Hanna, can't.  Wants to kill so and so.  Can't.  Wants to blah blah blah.\n\nThe narrative is clumsy and jagged.  The motivations of characters reverse for no real reason.  Deb wants to kill Dexter all of a sudden.  Nope, changed her mind, helping him again.  Now she is dead.  Dexter wants to live with Hanna, nope now he wants to kill himself now that Deb is dead.  Nope, he survived driving his boat through a hurricane and is now a logger.  There is a dangerous brain surgeon serial killer.  Nope, he is caught.  Now free again cause Dexter can't kill him.  Now caught, nope free.  Dexter has a new love interest, nope she is dead.  And on and on and on.  How are Masuka and his daughter getting along now?  Oh she uses drugs!\n\nThe show always struggled to be plausible, but in season eight it doesn't even bother trying.  Why is Hanna staying at your sister's house?  Why doesn't she wear a fucking wig when she goes out?  Again, look at the efforts they go to in Breaking Bad to disguise themself.  Now imagine Hanna walking into a hospital with no disguise AND GIVING THE ADDRESS WHERE SHE IS CURRENTLY STAYING! Why are you getting romantically involved with a serial killer whose MO is killing her partner?  And you left your son with her?  Great thinking Dex.\n\nI didn't watch Dexter to see the bumbling misadventures of a limp dicked blood spatter analysist as he just wants to be happy with his girlfriend.  I watched it because Dexter was a cool, powerful monster in plain sight.  The story was smart and felt like it was going places.  Season eight is like a parody of Dexter that forgot that parodies were supposed to at least be funny.",

It was simpler, more in your face etc.  Now that type of humor isn't bad, a lot of people like it, but part of why i liked community in the first place was the humor.  changing that to me makes it noticeably worse.  \n\nlastly i'll just briefly mention the tone.  a lot of it seemed more light heart-ed and not as heavy as some of the other seasons.  i remember episode one abed said \"that's the nicest thing anybody's ever said to me\" after jeff said \"i see your value now\"  while it sounds funny at first that is some dark shit.  i don't remember anything like this from the fourth season.  this might just be my selective memory of the earlier seasons at the time though.  \n\nnow there were things they did that i think were better than all the other seasons, but overall my view of it is less than the others.",

    "body": "As I read it, the OP did not consent even when drunk. Those the consent is dubious not just because of the alcohol involved but also because I think there might not have been any consent whatsoever. \n\nFurthermore, on Mandy's part, if she's partying with the secondary intention of banging the OP even after he's made it completely clear while relatively sober that he does not want to have sex with her, she is entirely to blame. The OP's lack of consent was not just implied (through an absence of active consent) but actually explicit. Now it's possible that Mandy was drinking with no intention of banging the OP but that after enough alcohol, she couldn't control herself even though she expected she would be able to. Then perhaps she's not entirely to blame, but any residual blame goes to the alcohol rather than to the OP. \n\nNow, if you were to wake up in someone's bed after you had told that person explicitly while sober, \"I don't want to have sex with you,\" would you still be blaming yourself? Especially given that the other person initiated the act and you were too out of it to really do anything to prevent it?",

You only got to do a tiny bit of what you hoped and only a few kids got to do the fun stuff (and only for a few minutes).  Spending a day walking through the museum was the best part by a large margin.  I still enjoy that when I pass through Huntsville.\n\nTo put this into perspective, I entered a trivia contest at DragonCon in the late 90s.  I tied for 2nd with two others.  The top 3 got to have a play off with the top prize being a trip to adult Space Camp.  The 4th place prize was a $50 gift certificate to a local used bookstore.  I volunteered to take 4th because I preferred the gift certificate to the trip (and the second and third prizes).",

Healy still tried to change his behaviour and do something he thought could genuinely help the inmates.\n\nYou also have to remember that a prison counsellor isn't the same as a counsellor on the outside. A prison counsellor is not a therapist and may not even be able to tell someone is suicidal compared to being severely depressed, let alone provide the level of care needed for someone who is seriously considering suicide. His job isn't the same as an 'outside world' counsellor. He made a recommendation for Soso to get antidepressants, and without that recommendation she may not have gotten any medication whatsoever. Antidepressants have to be closely monitored by a medical doctor at the start of the course. That she didn't receive that care isn't Healy's fault, because he is not in any way qualified to monitor someone's reaction to medication, which often includes increased suicidal urges to begin with.",

    "body": "Certainly an interesting video, but a lot of what he talks about is explained just fine within the confines of the show. Simply put, you can't place an expectation of optimal action on the main character, and you can't keep putting yourself in their shoes. To me, it's almost evidence that you want to like Kirito more than you do. Additionally, a lot of people overestimate Kirito's power level; he's about on level with Asuna for the entire game. Notably in the Death Scythe fight, he can't handle the boss and needs to 2v1 it with Asuna. Additionally, Klein and others are around the same strength level but simply don't have Kirito's reflexes or resolve, which he's honed through being a solo player.\n\nHe mentions something something about a support network and players banding together, and they do (the Army for instance, and the blacksmith dude who spends all of his profits helping level mid-level players), and he just missed that because our protagonist plays solo and the show lightly touches on all of those aspects.",

It's usually done when the regifter doesn't have a use, want, or need for the item and/or thinks that another person would like it.\n\nThe problem is that, generally speaking, if at any point it's revealed that the gift you gave someone was a regift, it suddenly cheapens the quality of the gift and can even be taken as an insult to the recipient.\n\nI can understand how it might reflect a cheap nature on the part of the gift-giver, but I think that if a regift really reflects one's belief that the recipient would like and value the gift, it mitigates the means to which the giver initially got it.",

    "body": "Zunes were never cool. CMV.\n\nLet's face it: Zune (the media delivery service, the actual device) was just a blatant attempt by Microsoft to compete and stay relevant when faced with an ascendant Apple. I'm by no means an Apple fanboy, but nothing is less cool than copying wholesale what is currently popular. The mp3 players looked bad, the sites were godawful, and Zune is generally considered to be emblematic of the tack the Microsoft has taken to compete with Apple, which hasn't been great. \"Leasing\" songs to your Zune-having friends was two steps forward idea-wise, but 3 steps back CRM-wise. Watching the build up and \"hype\" to the release of Zune was like watching a car crash in slow motion.\n\nI'm not saying that Zune was useless or uninteresting or ineffective, my view is simply that it isn't, and never was, cool. Hip. Desirable to have. You will have changed my view when you make me (or some past version of me) desire a Zune.",
