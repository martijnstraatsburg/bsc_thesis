No, absolutely not.  In that situation, as Zimmerman has claimed (and the evidence has pointed to) he was 100% well within his right to defend himself with lethal force if he felt like his life might be in danger.\n\nAnd I think in that situation, given the circumstance, it should be easy to think that anyone could feel that their life could be in danger if it was an ongoing attack that showed no signs of slowing down or stopping.\n\nTrayvon Martin is dead because Trayvon Martin threw the first punch, and then mount and continue to beat Zimmerman bloody.  \n\nIf Martin simply gets in his face and starts a verbal argument, and then Zimmerman shoots, its a completely different story and Zimmerman would be jail.  Martin sealed his fate with the vicious, continuing attack.  Plain and simple.  I don't know how someone with an honest bone in their body could argue otherwise.\n\nTrayvon was not \"unarmed\", fists can absolutely be a deadly weapon.",

It was similar to Intro to Felt Surrogacy in that each character had secrets that would upset the others and all those secrets were put on the table throughout the episode. In Felt Surrogacy, the secrets they each hold are of very different magnitudes. Troy started a 50 acre fire, while Jeff bailed on a date and felt bad about it. Everyone treats their secrets as if they have the same weight to them, and at the end they have a very sappy \"aww, we can all feel better about this now\" moment. In Cooperative Polygraphy each person's secret is given the appropriate weight. There character's secrets aren't just about things they did, but things they did to each other. There isn't a final moment of sappy sitcom closure where all the harm is undone and everyone hugs. Instead they grow as people. They realize that they're not as nice as they all might think of themselves being. Things mattered this time around.",

Obviously police cannot arbitrarily search people and places without a warrant or proper suspicion, which is part of our system of due process.\n\nHowever, if an individual is innocent and happens to match the profile of a suspect that just fleed the scene of a crime nearby, running away or tussling with the cop is not the appropriate response. There is a legal process to handle this. If someone just robbed a bank—or a convenience store—for example, the police should not just give up because the suspect isn't going to play nice and submit to questioning or arrest. If this happened, criminals would always just run away, and the police would be powerless because to do anything more would be to \"escalate.\"\n\nMichael Brown did not want to go to jail for what he had just done, I would imagine. In all likelihood, if he had submitted to arrest, he would have been in jail for a few hours—or a few days max until he was bailed out—and then given a fine, community service, and probation (of course he may have feared he'd spend the next six months in jail); his crime was not the most serious. Unfortunately, if the testimony and gunshot evidence is indeed all accurate, he doubled down on the stupid and decided to fight back against the police officer.",

He probably got out of the car and started shooting from where he was. I doubt he can shoot and run at the same time. If he was running after Brown he would have to holster his gun or run with his gun drawn, both of which would make him run more slowly than Brown who had a head start and probably in fear for his life.\n\nI believe the testimony that Wilson was shooting at Brown while he was running away, because it's the most reasonable explanation for why Brown turned around and put his hands up.\n\nSo from what I can piece together, Wilson was probably 30-40 yards away from Brown and Brown with his hands up, walking a few paces forward. If these are the facts then Wilson, a trained police officer, was clearly not in imminent danger.",

People that had a responsibility to report the incident (including Paterno) arguably did not do enough to 1) ensure that these incidents were properly investigated and 2) ensure that Sandusky did not continue to have unfettered access to victims.\n\nHowever, let's talk about the things that are questionable. People that arguably had the same (or a greater) requirement to report the incident in question were contacted by McQuery both before and after he met with Paterno. \n\nNow, let's talk about some things that weren't largely addressed in the media. Sandusky was not acting as a University official at the time of the incidents - he was acting as an official for the Second Mile, a charity organization that he himself founded. He used his access to the University to further the goals of this organization, but he was not a University employee - Paterno was not his boss and neither was Tim Curley. Despite this, both Paterno and Curley contacted superiors in regards to the incident (Paterno met with Curley the day after McQuery met with him; Curley met with Univeristy President Graham Spanier the day after that). \n\nCurley banned Sandusky from University facilities and also contacted the CEO of the Second Mile - the man who **was** Sandusky's boss, and comprised him of the incident. His response? He told Sandusky to wear shorts in the shower.\n\nNow, let's talk about the fact that *multiple people did not report the incident to law enforcement, despite a requirement to do so*. Within the entire chain, there are at least a dozen individuals who were apprised of a potentially criminal incident that should have contacted authorities, and yet they didn't. \n\nAt least three of Paterno's supervisors, Sandusky's boss at the Second Mile, and two board members from that organization had been informed about the incident.\n\nBut that's not all - a totally separate incident that went through an entirely separate chain of supervision (OPP - the division of the University responsible for maintenance) *had the same result.*\n\nDoesn't this point to a more systematic problem? One that perhaps goes beyond a single football coach? Isn't it possible that Paterno did what he thought was his responsibility, just like a dozen other people that were made aware of the incident?",

    "body": "Lame compared to what?  What is a finale that you found highly satisfying?\n\nThere are a couple reasons why these never live up to expectations.\n\n1) Once a show gets big, showrunners and the network are in a tug of war over how long it should continue.  Showrunners tend to want to end the show more quickly and efficiently, whereas the network wants to drag things out (because more episodes creates more money).  Breaking Bad is a good example of this.  You have the main antagonist (Gus) killed off in season 4, but there is still more airtime to fill, so the show has to build up a whole new (less intense and shorter) story with the White Power guys.  No finale in which Walt confronts the White Power guys could have been as powerful as the end of Gus.\n\nRelated to this is the Chekov's gun problem.  If you hang a gun on the wall in Act 1, someone has to fire it by Act 3.  As shows get dragged on in unnatural ways, especially shows with commercial breaks, you need to write in lots of cliffhangers, which often involve introducing new dimensions to the story (see: Lost).  This can easily get away for you and you end up leaving a bunch of loose threads or create continuity errors (see: Lost).  Breaking Bad ties up pretty much every plot and prop point though (i.e., the ricin).   \n\n2) Classically, narratives have a certain structure: rising action, climax, falling action, denouement (reflection).  In serial TV, the big problem is that everyone wants the finale to be a huge, blockbuster episode.  But, it isn't supposed to be.  You are supposed to have the huge climax sometime before the last hour of a 40+ hour story.  Really, the last episode should be pretty calm and character-driven (think everything in Lord of The Rings after they drop the ring in the mountain).    \n\nBreaking Bad actually dealt with falling action and denouement better than most shows.  You have the showdown in Ozymandias with Hank and, then a few episodes of Walt reflecting in New Hampshire.  But because the finale needs to have some sort of major climactic event, the show needed to build in the whole White Power showdown.  Basically, it is a very tough needle to thread, and Breaking Bad probably did it better than most.  Sopranos didn't even try.",

Goku and Vegeta killed Buu who was several times more powerful than Frieza.

Broly isn't part of it, and Baby/DBZ GT is out.\n\nWhat we *do* have is a huge theme and one single direct line, given by Goku: *The greater the opponent, the more I rise up.* (or something to that effect). In other words, he matches new challenges. \n\nIf you take a look at the Saiyans, they were all weaker than Frieza's main henchmen until Goku and Vegeta started 'rising up to meet the challenge' on a one-on-one basis against each other and against enemies like Pui Pui, Dodoria, Zarbon, and then the Ginyu Force. Every single one of these fights ended in severe injury and near death, but then an opportunity for Zenkai followed.\n\nThere's a small window of opportunity in a race that gets stronger in response to challenges. If the enemy is too weak, then there's no advancement; if the enemy is too strong, the Saiyan just dies.\n\nThus, Goku and Vegeta (and their children) are not exceptions to the rule at all, but rather extremely lucky to progressively face tougher foes on a step by step one-on-one basis.\n\nYou can see this window of opportunity *being missed* when Vegeta powers up after the Ginyu Force fight and is able to match first-form Frieza. Frieza transforms and gets stronger, and Vegeta simply loses. He survives with Dende's healing, and would be able to match second and third form Frieza for sure - but he fails again! Because Frieza's final form is just too strong. This is how most Saiyans would meet their end. He just happens to be revived by the Dragonballs later.\n\nSo the Saiyan race would not have simply all continued to get stronger to the point of threatening the universe. A great many of them would have gotten in fights over their heads and died; more would have picked on weaker races and failed to advance. Only a very small number of procedurally lucky fighters advance to levels like Goku and Vegeta.\n\nIn fact, Goku and Vegeta's luck ran out. They both died at various points. It's only the Dragonballs that are truly responsible for continuing their step-by-step slightly-stronger-enemy faceoffs. What we witness in DBZ is a race's tragic cultural flaw getting them into fights over their capabilities until they all get killed. Fighting people stronger than you is a Saiyan's best opportunity for advancement *and* greatest risk. Eventually, your luck runs out, and Saiyans were culturally bred to just be okay with that fact.\n\nFrieza couldn't count on luck, though. He saw their Zenkai enemy-matching ability and destroyed them to completely prevent it from getting out of control.",

He seems pretty reasonable in the beginning of the film.  Sure he's a bit of a dick to Eli, but honestly, Eli is a cunt.  For some reason, Daniel just snaps and goes Heisenberg the second H.W. loses his hearing.  Daniel's character is pretty much pointless after H.W. loses his hearing.  Now onto Eli.  Eli is a little whiny bitch.  Seriously, how does he have a following?  He has the worst public speaking voice ever, honestly, he sounds like a 4 year old having a temper tantrum.  I could see him having an actual following if he had a deeper voice, or had a more Hitler style of giving sermons.  Eli doesn't really serve any purpose after Daniel bought the land.  H.W.  H.W. is pretty much just Daniel's cute face, which at least Daniel admits, but he's really not relevant to the plot in the least and doesn't even need to exist.  Henry.  What the fuck was the point of that?  If there's any characters who I missed, well, they weren't memorable then.\n\n* Plot/Narrative:  There doesn't seem to be one.  What the fuck was that ending?\n\n* Storytelling:  I don't think the people who made this movie know what story telling actually is, the entire film just seems disjointed and makes no sense.  \n\n* Music:  The music didn't really add to the movie in most cases, it just was kind of in the way.\n\nSo, there's my reasons for not liking the movie.  So many people give it such high praise, and I don't even understand why.  I checked the Wikipedia article for it and the worst reviews it got basically said \"meh.\"  I'm not even meh about this movie, I downright don't like it.",
