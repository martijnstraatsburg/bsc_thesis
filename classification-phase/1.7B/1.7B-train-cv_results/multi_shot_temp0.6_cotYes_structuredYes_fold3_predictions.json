    "body": "The third book is absent of danger? What about the Dementors that Harry regularly encounters, nearly dying most of the time? While Sirius Black ends up being an ally, for the first part of the book, there definitely was a very real fear of the idea of Sirius Black. \n\nPoA has a lot of the same elements (such as how developed the world is and the humour, etc.) as the first two books, but is a lot darker in a sense. It builds up an inevitably direct clash between good and evil. You mention that the best books are ones like the Chamber of Secrets, but Voldemort didn't even really come into play until the end; the characters were more worried about the Basilisk (though they didn't know it was, in fact, a Basilisk). In PoA, there is supposed to be someone directly out to get Harry, which doesn't go for the first two. In my opinion, that's more of a danger.\n\nRegarding angst: books like The Goblet of Fire and The Order of the Phoenix are way, way more angsty. In fact, off the top of my head, all that I can really think about that qualifies as angst in PoA is when Harry contemplates going after Sirius Black (which isn't even necessarily teenage angst, seeing as it could happen to anyone), and Ron and Hermione's issues with each other. As a matter of fact, I think that one of the better parts of PoA is that develops characters in a much better way than the first two books, while not laying it on too much. The characters grow way more in this book than the first two, and there are way more moral issues and such.\n\nAnd yet, even though there's character development and such, one thing I really like about PoA is that it still retains similar flavour and charm from the first two books. However, it's the only year where disasters and other things don't ruin the year for the students, even though dark events are still unfolding. Things like the Boggart lesson and the Quidditch final are enjoyable because nothing like that really happens in other books. In the first book, everything was new and shiny; in the second, there were people being attacked; in the fourth book, there was the Triwizard Tournament; in the fifth, there was Umbridge; in the sixth, the anti-Voldemort movement was started, and the the last book was barely at Hogwarts. PoA mixes the danger of the second with the world-building of the first in a good way. \n\nIt's also a really good transition and set-up for the Voldemort-filled part of the series, and the ending isn't a perfect Hollywood ending like the first two. There are doubts and the real servant of Voldemort is on the loose at the end. It's less sweet. It's nice to have Harry save the day, win a million points for Gryffindor with his antics, and have his friends all cheer for him, but it's far more interesting to have an ending that leaves you with questions and doubts for the next book. Voldemort doesn't hurt Harry at the end, but his servant is off to resurrect him. \n\nAlso, I don't know why you're merely dismissing the backstory and time travel aspects. The backstory was really interesting. The time travel was plain cool. It was icing on the cake, but at least it can help in avoiding last place. \n\nFinally, the third book is, in my opinion, one of the best to re-read. For more intense books like the last one, a lot of the intensity/drama/action/suspense is lost when you re-read it. The PoA is a good mix of mystery and other stuff, so it's better for re-reading. \n\n**TL;DR, PoA has more danger, better character development and world-building, a better ending and re-read value, and lots of other cool factors, including time travel.**",

One example I just remembered is the Ministry being a much more real presence, which brought a maturity to a world that was mostly run by a just-kids mentality for two books. However, even though the distractions from Voldemort were much-needed and never boring, it feels like PoA was artificially set up as such. The later books (i.e. the much longer ones) had what I feel is a better balance of non-Voldy plot development and main storyline events. But in PoA, it feels like Rowling decided to dedicate an entire book to just fleshing out the world. It was obviously successful, but I think it stands out as something like a very interesting intermission for the series instead of a legitimate entry in the saga of Harry Potter, the Boy who Lived.",

There was some ambiguity in his character that keeps you intrigued. There is obviously something to his relationship with H.W. that goes beyond simple exploitation. Saving him from the oil well and the way he cradle him afterwards shows that there is some sort feelings there. Also how he greets H.W. on his return from the school again shows that something has developed between them. Also his interactions with Henry show that he wanted some sort of human relationship otherwise he would of just sent him away after their first meeting.\n\nI didn't have any problem with the structure of the movie or the leaps in time. This is the first I've heard of anybody having issue with that as well. I don't know what else to say about that.\n\nI don't think broader context was really necessary for the film and in fact think that the intense focus on Plainview was one of its strengths. I think broadening the focus would have meant that the film would have lost its tension.\n\nI don't see Plainview killing Eli as puzzling. In fact I think it is really the only ending that would have made sense. What happens to somebody that is driven by success to sociopathic ends after they win that success? They turn on themselves and anybody around them. This is why it also showed Plainview pushing H.W. out of his life for good.",

Dr. Vogel's character, while brilliantly played by Charlotte Rampling, made no fucking sense.  Her connection to Dexter and Harry is ludicrous.  At no point in the series was she even hinted at.  To me, it was clear that the writers never envisioned this aspect of Dexter's myth when they created the show and the character, it was purely forced into place for this one season.  \n  \nThe other new characters also seemed to only be introduced to be killed so that the characters we've all come to know get to live (save Deb, who dies because of a one in a million blood clot- just so she and Dex can have one last conversation while she's in the hospital).  No other arc is closed.  Angel, Quinn, and Matthews are still in the dark about who Dexter really was.  This makes LaGuerta's death even more pointless than it already seemed.  Jamie still hasn't done anything important.  \n  \nThose things plus Dexter and Hannah turning into bumbling idiots as already pointed out turned the last season into a disaster.  The other HUGE GAPPING hole that was never addressed in either S7 or S8 was the scene in S5 where Deb walks in on Dexter and Lumen about to kill Jordan Chase (they can't see each other because of a opaque tarp) and Deb lets them go.  Suddenly Deb finds out Dexter is a serial killer and has this huge crisis of conscious.  In what universe does it make sense that the scene in the basement never comes up between the two of them???????????????",

Off the top of my head from the first 3 seasons you have Paintball, the Bottle ep, the Xmas claymation, Halloween zombies, Paintball II, D&amp;D, the video game ep, and the alternate universe ep. Nothing from S4 comes to mind.\n\nOf course comedy is subjective but I don't think S4 has a single ep worthy of a top 10 and would be lucky to have one or two in the top 20. At the same time if we did a bottom 10 it wouldn't be all S4 or even half S4 so it isn't as bad as some make it.

If one party is that drunk, and sex still happened, it implies the other party was not.\n\nIn the situation you mentioned, you might be too drunk to safely operate a motor vehicle, but not too drunk to consent. If both parties were equally drunk, however, then they were both equally able to consent.",

It's hard to read either account without noting that Wilson did not make it clear to the men what was taking place before initiating the altercation. Wilson had yelled from his window for the two to stop walking in the street, and was upset when they didn't immediately change course. He reversed to them, tried to open his door, but it shut back on him because he didn't have room to open it. So, Wilson grabbed Brown by the neck from his window and started lecturing him, though no one is sure of their conversation, this is when the scuffle started.\n\nThis cop didn't use his speaker or lights or follow any normal police procedures to let these guys know what was going on. I don't dispute that Brown scared him at some point, but he approached this in a way that escalates situations, not defuses them as police are trained to do.

    "body": "Admittedly the facism thing was just bullshit. But here are some points we can move along on. \n\n1)Cops are trained to subdue people. This is true, but they are also trained to be physically fit, courteous/professional, and competent in the law. However, most cops rarely get more than 6 months of training. Taking into account that 6 months of doing anything puts the average person at a skill level of just above novice, we have to know what their abilities are. Cops will not be able to stop an assailant without causing serious injury or death. Just like anyone else, they are entitled to kill if an assailant presents them with the intent to harm/kill them. Police do not magically have the ability to subdue criminals.\n\n2)Killing someone is rarely the best option. But we hardly choose our circumstances, especially when our assailants force those circumstances on us. We have to recognize that police officers being attacked can not change circumstances simply because they have been trained. They are just like any other average person. And so they should be given the right to defend themselves just like any other average person.\n\n3)If cops should/ought to be the type of people to be able to prevail over these kinds of circumstances then we need to either extend the rights of the average citizen as to make the service of police obsolete or we need to extensively reconstruct the way we train police officers. I think that in order to satisfy your standard of what an officer should be able to do, we need to train them to be on par with special military forces. The problem with that is that we give the government a paramilitary force in small towns. \nImagine if you will: Police are trained to a standard such that they can physically subdue someone 100lbs heavier than them. Do we really want every police officer in our town to have that much power? Do we want government giving orders to such people? Police forces are already corrupt but now they have the physical power to act with impunity. I guess this is where my facism thing ties in.\n\nIn short, we either need to give more rights to citizens so that police are obsolete and we can avoid police brutality or we must train police to be on par with the military and risk giving government and police too much power.",

At least when citizens defend themselves they are held liable to the full extent of the law.

    "body": "First of all, Dale is a much better role model than John Redcorn. Redcorn is a womanizing, selfish, greedy (as evidenced by how he's willing to drop Luanne's Manger Babies from his VHS distribution company), and all around pompous person (he thinks his shitty death metal band is the greatest thing ever). He's also an extremely anger filled man, constantly discussing taking revenge on \"the white man\". \n\nDale, albeit a little crazy and paranoid, is actually kind, caring, thoughtful and above all else, selfless (remember when he saved the Stick-Tec office by killing thousands of roaches with his bare hands? Or when he rushed to save Joseph from the alien overlords at the Marfa Lights? Or the countless times he's shown his devotion and love for his wife?). The only thing Dale really dislikes is Bill, for being so pathetic and disgusting, and Rusty Shackleford, for totally made up reasons. \n\nSo it's much better for Joseph to grow up a little weird if it means he gets to learn good, quality values. The only thing he'd learn from John Redcorn is how to be a selfish asshole who fucks any woman he can in a vendetta against an entire race of people. \n\nWe also see that Joseph thinks John Redcorn is a pretty weird dude in the Thanksgiving episode, so I'm pretty sure going to live with him would be pretty damaging to Joseph. Not to mention that John Redcorn doesn't know the first thing about parenting.   \n\nAlso, sure John Redcorn might be hurt that he doesn't get to raise Joseph, *but that's the price you pay when you stick your dick in another man's wife*. Seriously, fuck John Redcorn. I'm glad he has to silently suffer while watching Dale raise his kid. He's a piece of shit, so the resulting harm to him is negligible.\n\nAnd as other people said, Hank typically stays out of people's personal business. Even if it's totally fucked up, he tries to keep personal details like sexual relations completely secret (he doesn't even like Luanne using the bathroom in his and Peggy's room). He would *never* broach the subject of intimate sexual relations with his friends - he avoids those conversations at all costs (watch the episode where Connie gets her first period for ample evidence of this aversion). \n\nHe also sees how destructive divorce can be, thanks to Bill. Hank sort of sees the value in \"ignorance is bliss\" at least when it comes to Dale. Bill at least has a steady paying military job. Dale would be homeless trying to live off of Dale's Deadbug (we're constantly reminded that Nancy is the breadwinner, and we see in the episode where Nancy goes to work in Dallas that Dale cannot take care of himself). So it's actually better for Dale to not be privy to the true father of Joseph as well. \n\nIf Hank told Dale, and Dale believed him (which is also a stretch), then it would ruin pretty much everyone's lives who are involved in it. Dale becomes homeless, Joseph is now a child of divorced parents who realizes at 13 that he's a different race than he thought, Nancy would have to deal with the publicity that would likely result from this, and John Redcorn's life as he knows it comes crashing down once he has legal guardianship over a child (no more banging sluts when he's gotta take Joseph to football practice).",

That said-\nThis is true, which is why real world politicians tend to not make grand promises of what they will accomplish, but rather what they will fight for- with no guarantee of delivery.  Her campaign was run purely on hopes and dreams, and more than a few politicians have seen the end of their careers when they failed to deliver those.  Failure of this magnitude is a justifiable reason to seek a change in president, regardless of how realistic the goal is.\nThis is an illogical response, one born of emotion rather than reason.  Understandable, but not justifiable.  They are offering badly needed aid, that you arguably may not survive without.  It could be suicide to dismiss them, meeting them with violence could be costly, and trusting them explicitly would be unwise.  Therefore the rational solution is to accept their aid, but monitor them closely and limit their movement until you can be sure of their trustworthiness.  I believe that Adama satisfied these conditions in the initial standoff when they arrived.  Their interaction with the fleet was limited, and Galactica positioned itself with a lethal response ready at all times until their trust was earned by way of the testimony of trusted allies and deeds done by the Cylons.  Even then Adama was reluctant, but was pressed by circumstance to accept them.  Mind you, this is how they handled Athena when she returned with Helo.\nVery true.  At that point, their government bore little resemblance to a democracy and looked much more like a dictatorship, though I would argue this was necessary given the fragility of the fleet and responsibilities of its admiral.  Despite it's deeply negative stigma and undemocratic nature, martial law is not without its merits when used responsibly.\n\nNow here comes the part where I disagree with you- mutiny was not the answer.  I will admit that mutiny is a justifiable means in certain scenarios, but this was not one of them. \n\n* Firstly, Adama's actions were (mostly) neither unreasonable nor without their own justifications, which as I recall was communicated to the fleet.  His unofficial reign after Roslin's unofficial abdication was also very short before the mutiny, which was orchestrated by people with a long-standing grudge (Zarek and Gaeta).\n\n* Secondly, the primary spark was the presence of the Cylons who made every effort to be valuable to the fleet and nonthreatening.  As I said above, violent opposition to their presence was irrational.\n\n* Third, Adama and his loyalty had been proven multiple times at this point, having saved the fleet more times than anyone can count, and his judgement has proven sound throughout their years on the run.  The sudden change of opinion in the fleet was ignorant of this.  While it's not really reasonable to say he should never be doubted, it should have given far more pause than the colonists gave.\n\n* Finally, mutiny was a potentially self-destructive action.  Given the precarious position the fleet was in, a mutiny could have resulted in unnecessary loss of life (it did), loss of critical ships/resources/infrastructure, permanent damage to the survivability of the fleet and, by extension, the human race.\n\n**TL;DR**, Given the risks, Adama's track record, and irrational motivations, I find that while mutiny was not without cause, it was unjustified as a solution, especially above other options.\n\n-edit- words, etc.",

However I do think that not having to cut weight is something of an advantage at heavyweight.  Whether or not it's more of an advantage than size itself is debatable, but clearly most heavyweights don't bulk up to 265, and there are very few human beings that would have to cut down to 265 (unless they're fat obviously).  There seems to be diminishing returns on size once you get well over 200 lbs.  Ali wasn't that big himself, though he had a huge reach, much like Jon Jones, who many would have considered a favorite at heavyweight, even against the likes of Cain Velasquez.  It's extremely rare for fighters in other divisions to weigh in at less than a pound or two under the limit.  If UFC had a super heavyweight division I probably wouldn't give Lesnar as much credit.\n\nCain also has more losses in title fights, and what he may or may not do in the future is irrelevant.  Couture has more wins in title fights than Cain, especially if you consider his lhc reigns.  Would you consider Couture above Cain?",

    "body": "That is true Kirito and Asuna took on Death Scythe together but really Kirito's dual wielding and newfound skill was what won the fight. Klein is not on Kirito's level in terms of strength, power or even battle-healing. IIRC Kirito has maxed out most if not all of his battle stats whilst Klein has decent to high-range stats. Not much of what he has mentioned has been explained in the actual series. I can't like Kirito because he never struggles to progress, he always screams his way out of everything and has never lost a fight. He breaks out of paralysis and saves Asuna, how did that happen? He destroys a boss monster because he's pissed off that his guild was wiped? I thought this was a group game? None of this can be explained because the writer made that fatal mistake. Top 50 anime don't make these core mistakes.\n\n\nSticking together is the best bet for every character in a group-based MMO but apparently Kirito is above that. Another question is how is Asuna's stats roughly lower or the same as Kirito's when she has been with an actual guild doing far more dungeons than what Kirito seemed to be doing?",

    "body": "There are two issues with Deflategate that are at odds with each other:\n\n1. There is a mountain of circumstantial evidence (but no direct evidence) suggesting that McNally deliberately deflated the Patriots footballs, and that Tom Brady knew about it.\n2. The Patriots footballs were not deflated.\n\nThese points are diametrically opposed and mutually exclusive. Only one of those two things is true.\n\nYou detailed all the aspects of Point #1. It's an incredibly compelling story, filled with drama. There's a villain, there's a conspiracy, there's a fall from grace. It's awesome.\n\nPoint #2 is much more mundane. The Patriots balls were at 12.50 PSI before the game, they lost 1.01 PSI due to the cold weather, and that's that. It's a boring explanation.\n\nIt's science versus faith.\n\nPoint #1 has a lot of vague inferences that you can interpret however you like. You choose to interpret them to mean that footballs were deflated; I interpret them another way. Regardless of interpretation, the story doesn't have an \"I prefer footballs below 12.5\", or \"I'll deflate the footballs\", or security footage of deflation, or a confession, or any witnesses at all. There is no direct evidence. You can make your interpretations, and have faith that they're correct.\n\nPoint #2 is pure science. According to the Ideal Gas Law, the Patriots footballs should have lost between 0.98 and 1.18 PSI during the first half *if they were not deflated*. They lost 1.01 PSI. Therefore, they were not deflated.\n\nI'm not trying to change your view, I just want to point out the difference between the groups, and make it clear which group you are in.",
