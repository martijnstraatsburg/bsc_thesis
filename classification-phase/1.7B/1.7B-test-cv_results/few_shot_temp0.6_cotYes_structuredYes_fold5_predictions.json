    "body": "If you watch the video the officer doesn't shoot the dog in self defense.  Twice he reaches for the dogs leash and the dog tries to bite or lunge at him.  Shortly after the second time, when the dog is just standing there, he shoots it.  You can see that the dog is standing on the sidewalk at least 5 or 6 feet away from the officer when he fires.  I'd understand if he shot it while the dog was in the act of trying to bite him but he clearly wasn't.  The dog was only threatening the officer when the officer threatened him.  But despite the threat not being imminent he shot the dog because he's incompetent.  \n\nAfter he realized it was a bad idea to try and grab the dog's leash, he should have stopped to think for a second and figured something better out.  The best solution would have been to uncuff the owner for a little second to secure the dog.  The owner wasn't violent and not a threat to the police, you can see he immediately complied when they asked to cuff him.  \n\nEven if they aren't going to uncuff a suspect, all cops have at least one form of non-lethal force.  Either a taser or pepper spray.  They also have training into when it's appropriate to use non-lethal vs lethal force.  Either one of these would have worked fantastically at taking down a dog, but the officer came over gun-drawn to deal with it.  Why did he need his gun out?  Why didn't he have his taser out instead?  Was there some situation where he thought he would need a gun going on there?  Clearly he made a major mistake in deciding what type of force to use.",

    "body": "Sorry for the delay in responding; life and such. Okay, you’re starting to convince me that there was more at play than I initially suspected, but I have a few more questions that you might be able to clear up.\n\n* You’ve convinced me that Oswald acted alone, or at least plausibly could have made the shots that killed Kennedy and wounded Gov. Connally. Re-examining the distance Oswald was shooting from and the fact that he did actually miss twice, it fits that someone with his marksmanship skills would’ve done poorly but still hit his target.\n\n* I’m still skeptical about why a communist group would want to kill JFK. You’re right to point out that post-assassination most of the American public was more concerned with the effect the attack had on domestic affairs and the personal lives of the First Lady, etc. Yet that ignores the fact that LBJ immediately succeeding Kennedy led to increases in tensions with the USSR both in the short term and more over in the long term. I still don’t see why communist groups would want to kill Kennedy in Dallas; why didn’t they kill him around the Bay of Pigs or the Cuban Missile Crisis? I also feel like you brush off them trusting Oswald; if he was actually hired and then apprehended, he would have still had plenty of time to tell one of the Dallas police officers or FBI agents who interrogated him for several hours at least some degree of information about who had hired him. Sure, the FBI might have thought he was a nut, but in the immediate aftermath of a presidential assassination, I seriously doubt that they wouldn’t have followed up on every piece of information he provided, regardless of how crazy it sounded (and communists hiring an assassin in the political climate of the early 60’s isn’t that crazy). Sure, Oswald *didn’t* rat on the people who hired him (aside from saying he was a “patsy”) but the odds that he *might* have still seem to me to preclude a communist group from hiring such a lose cannon (who, again, defected *away* from the USSR despite initially professing his love for the Soviets).\n\n* If you can convince me on the Russia/Communist angle, I’m starting to buy the next link in the chain, of Mafia involvement. That said, I don’t see the evidence in your argument for Mafia involvement. Sure, they *could* have, and I see their motivations, but what is your actual proof for Mafia involvement?",

    "body": "I'm not sure that I would say one is definitively better than the other, but four years at that age makes a huge difference.  While you acknowledge the age gap and Aang's age at the time, I don't think you give him the leeway that he probably deserves.  \n\nIf we look at a 12 year old versus a 16 year old in our (or at least an American context), it's night and day.  While the 12 year old is struggling through the early stages of puberty, trying to find their way in 7th/8th grade, and beginning to learn about teenage life, the 16 year old is already living it.  While a person isn't necessarily super mature at 16, they are certainly going to be more mature than any 12 year old on average.\n\nHere's a kid who is born in desperate times, and expected to save the world.  That's pretty heavy if you're an adult, much less a 12 year old child.  I look back to what I was doing when I was 12 and I can tell you I wouldn't be ready to digest the notion of saving the world in a literal sense.  \nThis is because he does not want to kill, nor does he think he is capable of doing so.  I mean, he's scared too, but he doesn't know if he can beat Ozai much less kill him if he did win the fight.  Again, 12 year old.  Asking a 12 year old to perform the coup de grace is pretty gnarly.  It felt a little deus ex machina-like when the lion turtle gave him an alternate solution, but I had no trouble believing a young kid would be pretty freaked out by the implication that he had to kill someone.\n\nIn reality, Aang's whining is actually a pretty accurate portrayal of what an actual 12 year old acts like.  He has bursts of brilliance and is indeed more mature than most real 12 year olds, but his character was written extremely well.  Air nomads don't like to be held to one spot -- and by extension, I'd assume they wouldn't like to be held down by destiny.  Couple his background with his age, and you have a pretty darn good 12 year old character.\n\nIs he \"better\" than Korra? I'm not sure anyone can really settle that (not right now anyway).  However, I do think you're being a bit too harsh on Aang.",

    "body": "An eight year old boy says \"When I grow up, I want to be an astronaut.\"\n\nOf course, from his perspective, he genuinely means it. He's seen an astronaut in a movie, maybe, and thinks it looks cool. He has no actual understanding of what an astronaut does, or how rigid and dangerous is. He has no idea that when he turns 12 he's going to discover how much he  actually hates the boring work of astronomy and physics, and that he's not really into working out and prefers writing poetry. By the time he's an adult, being an astronaut is the LAST thing he wants to be.\n\nBut that doesn't mean it's not 'genuine' when he said it as a kid. Kids are nothing if not genuine. What it means is that he said it in the way kids say all things: uninformed, mostly emotional, imitating adult behaviors and media depictions with little real understanding. From his perspective, he really does want to be an astronaut, and from an adult perspective, we know that's cute precisely because it's such a child's understanding of the world; that's why we say \"Awww\".\n\nChildhood crushes are the same way. Of course they're absolutely nothing like adult crushes. Of course kids have none of the vital information (like, say, their sexual preferences) that will shape their adult desires. A childhood crush is much more like \"play\", but to kids, play has all the emotional weight of real action. It's incredibly different from an adult crush, but that doesn't make it false or worse, lying to oneself.",

He is struggling with his own mental illness, and is profoundly sad and lonely.  When he tries to reach out to an adult he trusts (Mr. Antolini), he learns he has ulterior motives.\n\nI don't understand people who don't have sympathy for Holden.  Is it because he's rich?  And you think that people who come from rich families have no right to feel deep emotional pain?  This is a story of an abandoned child doing his best to navigate his world without any kind of guide.  What's more sympathetic than that?\n\nAs far as my own personal love for the book, I can tell you that when I read it as a teenager, I had an epiphany-like experience of feeling like someone else in the world might actually understand me.  I was neglected, I was mentally ill and not getting treatment, and when Holden said it was the kind of cold where you felt like you were going to disappear every time you crossed the street, I thought *\"Oh my God, somebody GETS me.\"*\n\nThis book isn't for everyone, but for some people it is a profoundly validating experience.  Maybe you didn't suffer in the same way as Holden when you were a child.  Maybe you have a different kind of coping strategy, a different kind of resilience.  But Holden's voice is so true to how so many of us feel, when we read that book we feel as if J.D. Salinger has reached out and held our hand.",

That was basically it. That is not, to me, an interesting character. The disjointed happenings the author used to beat those aspects of this character into my head for no other reason than \"because he's the main character\" were not something I found to be well written.\nIs a character that is insane supposed to suddenly *be* interesting to read about? My point is that all of his personality can be summed up by \"tragedy broke his mind and sent him into a spiral of idiocy and insanity.\" He was an insane hypocrite. That's all he was and that is utterly one dimensional.\n\nThere wasn't, as I recall, much of a showing of who he was before he lost his mind, so it doesn't even make for a compelling tragic tale to me.
