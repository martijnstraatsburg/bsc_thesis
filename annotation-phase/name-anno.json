Shortly after the second time, when the dog is just standing there, he shoots it.  You can see that the dog is standing on the sidewalk at least 5 or 6 feet away from the officer when he fires.  I'd understand if he shot it while the dog was in the act of trying to bite him but he clearly wasn't.  The dog was only threatening the officer when the officer threatened him.  But despite the threat not being imminent he shot the dog because he's incompetent.  \n\nAfter he realized it was a bad idea to try and grab the dog's leash, he should have stopped to think for a second and figured something better out.  The best solution would have been to uncuff the owner for a little second to secure the dog.  The owner wasn't violent and not a threat to the police, you can see he immediately complied when they asked to cuff him.  \n\nEven if they aren't going to uncuff a suspect, all cops have at least one form of non-lethal force.  Either a taser or pepper spray.  They also have training into when it's appropriate to use non-lethal vs lethal force.  Either one of these would have worked fantastically at taking down a dog, but the officer came over gun-drawn to deal with it.  Why did he need his gun out?  Why didn't he have his taser out instead?  Was there some situation where he thought he would need a gun going on there?  Clearly he made a major mistake in deciding what type of force to use.",

Just looking at us you would say i am more of a threat, but if after 3 minutes conversation you realize she is a serial killer and i am a teddy bear you will feel ridiculous for your earlier assumption. It is fine to make this assumption, it is not fine to act on it without information. If you saw me and said woman in a fight you would immediately target me, not realizing she is the dangerous one.

In Aliens, there were a ton of aliens, making the adversary even more terrifying. However, in the third movie, they are back to one alien. So, how do they up the terror factor in a world with one alien? See next point.\n\n- No weapons. The only way to create tension with only one alien is to have a world with no weapons. Are you kidding me? Now, Alien and Aliens are still great horror\/sci-fi movies without the action, but the whole \"don't shoot them, they bleed acid\" and \"you need a flamethrower\" themes have completely been thrown out.

Thus, it takes on traits of the dog, looks like a dog, etc. Apparently, this is why the aliens in the first two movies look like they do; they used humans as hosts. Apparently, this is a mythology point with the alien franchise. BUT IT IS NEVER EXPLAINED. The alien also looks very different from what we expect, but they never explain why.\n\n- The fucking 1st person camera angles. Oh my God.

The tension of a female prisoner on a world of celibate men is also great.\n\nHowever, the following things are really annoying:\n\n- In the first movie, there was one alien. In Aliens, there were a ton of aliens, making the adversary even more terrifying. However, in the third movie, they are back to one alien. So, how do they up the terror factor in a world with one alien? See next point.\n\n- No weapons. The only way to create tension with only one alien is to have a world with no weapons. Are you kidding me? Now, Alien and Aliens are still great horror\/sci-fi movies without the action, but the whole \"don't shoot them, they bleed acid\" and \"you need a flamethrower\" themes have completely been thrown out. They are completely defenseless, and the lack of any firearm action really takes away from the movie.\n\n- The fact that the alien they are fighting used a dog as a host. Thus, it takes on traits of the dog, looks like a dog, etc. Apparently, this is why the aliens in the first two movies look like they do; they used humans as hosts. Apparently, this is a mythology point with the alien franchise. BUT IT IS NEVER EXPLAINED. The alien also looks very different from what we expect, but they never explain why.\n\n- The fucking 1st person camera angles. Oh my God. Because they can't have multiple alien kills or any kind of firearm violence, they attempt to up the scares with first person shots of the alien chasing people. We know you are going to die, just die already!",

    "body": "You're comparing apples to oranges here.  Aang's story arc was acceptance of his role as the avatar.  Remember he only found out he was the Avatar a few days before he fled.  He was 12, and he was faced with this overwhelming burden of fighting a war. The series ends with him being a fully realized Avatar at the age of 12\/13 and fully accepting his duties because he found a way to harmonize his beliefs with his duties.  \n\nKorra's character arc is completely different.  She's already done that. She realized she was the Avatar at the age of 4.  She was raised in peace time and security. \n\nAlso, lets look at what being the avatar meant to both Korra and Aang.  For Aang it meant losing all of his friends, losing his teacher, dedicating himself to years more training when he thought he only had to master one element, and fight a looming war with the dangerous fire nation.

Aang was fairly spiritual and able to easily get into the Spirit World while it took Korra most of the first two books to get to that point. \n\nI don't discount the struggle, but Aang certainly made things worse for himself.

Assuming that he would be able to fend off the attackers at the Air Temples, the Water Tribes and the Earth Kingdom were not withered by the Hundred Year War. The Fire Nation had nowhere near the foothold on a global scale as they had a hundred years later so it would be easier for Aang to bid his time and train.

He has bursts of brilliance and is indeed more mature than most real 12 year olds, but his character was written extremely well.

Couple his background with his age, and you have a pretty darn good 12 year old character.\n\nIs he \"better\" than Korra? I'm not sure anyone can really settle that (not right now anyway).

Both are 4 year age gaps, but the contrast is much sharper for the lower age pair.  Most people wouldn't bat an eye at, say, the 45 year old and the 49 year old getting into a relationship, but a 12 and a 16 year old in a relationship would be considered odd\/wrong\/etc.  Why?  Because a dearth in years means a lot more at that age.\n\nIt's not to say a 16 is fully mature, or isn't changing, or has nothing left to learn.  Far from it.  It just that it's even more amplified for someone even younger.  The average 16 year old would be much more mentally equipped to handle the stress and pressure of having to save the world than a 12 year old.  \nSure -- to a point.  If, say, one of your parents pass away when you are 12, it can certainly cause you to \"grow up\" faster, but it doesn't mean you're suddenly as mature as an adult.  Indeed, kids growing up in a wartime situation are probably going to be a bit more mature than similarly aged peace time kids, but they aren't adults by any stretch of the imagination. \n\nAt the same time, kids say some poignant things from time to time, and if a kid was raised by monks I'm sure their outlook would be heavily influenced by that.  Further, he is the reincarnation of the avatar.  He has no shortage of experience to draw from, and I don't think it always has to be in some dramatic fashion when he does so.  \n\nBasically, I don't really see any major plot holes\/issues by having kids that understand the urgency of an important mission but still fall prey to the inexperience of their years.  I mean, like, watch a TED talk of some 14 year old trying to do something crazy\/cool like provide cheap\/clean water for people in Africa.  On one hand they certainly understand the gravitas of the water situation, want to help out, etc.  On the other hand, watching them present their findings\/research\/product clearly shows that at the end of the day they are still a young (or relatively young) child.

If I had to take a stab at explaining why I think that, its that I felt TLA was more free to explore the world of Avatar, while LOK is confined to certain parameters set forth by TLA.  To me it's like the same reason fan fiction is never really as good as the original.  It doesn't mean none of it is enjoyable, but they are writing essentially a derivative work that has to fit in the confines of the existing world.

But in any event, while subsequent works can certainly be enjoyable and fun to read, any author (including Rowling herself) is bound by the original rules of the original series.  Any written work in that universe cannot (figuratively) be allowed to negate or trivialize previous struggles by inventing new stuff.

Can you imagine the allure of a woman who couldn't care less about your fame after years of being chased by screaming girls every time you set foot in public?\n\nI think you'll find also that they were extremely aligned in their philosophical and political beliefs, which was the bedrock of their relationship really. Also, from 1975-1980 he virtually withdrew completely from the public eye to be with his family. People with trophy wives (which is essentially what you are equating Yoko to) simply don't do that.",

As a matter of fact, I think that one of the better parts of PoA is that develops characters in a much better way than the first two books, while not laying it on too much.

The backstory was really interesting. The time travel was plain cool. It was icing on the cake, but at least it can help in avoiding last place. \n\nFinally, the third book is, in my opinion, one of the best to re-read. For more intense books like the last one, a lot of the intensity\/drama\/action\/suspense is lost when you re-read it. The PoA is a good mix of mystery and other stuff, so it's better for re-reading. \n\n**TL;DR, PoA has more danger, better character development and world-building, a better ending and re-read value, and lots of other cool factors, including time travel.**",

Book 5 was action light- they were mostly ignoring Voldemort and focusing on Hogwarts dramas, and so that was my favorite. But book 3 was nothing exception in its lack of combat in the main book. \n\nBook 2 was actually slower for me.

The request for cash clearly sounds like a joke, especially in the context of the rest of their text message jokes. \nAgain, players sign all kinds of stuff, I don't see any reason to suggest this was some kind of quid pro quo.

He trusts his wife so much that cheating never enters the equation.\n\n When confronted with Joseph not being his son, clearly aliens. That was mute logical top him than his wife cheating. \n\nAs for his paranoia easy to think something in his past broke his trust in the government, now look at him. Imagine if he lost his trust in women\/ his wife. What would that do to his family?",

    "body": "First of all, Dale is a much better role model than John Redcorn. Redcorn is a womanizing, selfish, greedy (as evidenced by how he's willing to drop Luanne's Manger Babies from his VHS distribution company), and all around pompous person (he thinks his shitty death metal band is the greatest thing ever). He's also an extremely anger filled man, constantly discussing taking revenge on \"the white man\". \n\nDale, albeit a little crazy and paranoid, is actually kind, caring, thoughtful and above all else, selfless (remember when he saved the Stick-Tec office by killing thousands of roaches with his bare hands? Or when he rushed to save Joseph from the alien overlords at the Marfa Lights? Or the countless times he's shown his devotion and love for his wife?). The only thing Dale really dislikes is Bill, for being so pathetic and disgusting, and Rusty Shackleford, for totally made up reasons. \n\nSo it's much better for Joseph to grow up a little weird if it means he gets to learn good, quality values. The only thing he'd learn from John Redcorn is how to be a selfish asshole who fucks any woman he can in a vendetta against an entire race of people. \n\nWe also see that Joseph thinks John Redcorn is a pretty weird dude in the Thanksgiving episode, so I'm pretty sure going to live with him would be pretty damaging to Joseph. Not to mention that John Redcorn doesn't know the first thing about parenting.   \n\nAlso, sure John Redcorn might be hurt that he doesn't get to raise Joseph, *but that's the price you pay when you stick your dick in another man's wife*. Seriously, fuck John Redcorn. I'm glad he has to silently suffer while watching Dale raise his kid. He's a piece of shit, so the resulting harm to him is negligible.\n\nAnd as other people said, Hank typically stays out of people's personal business. Even if it's totally fucked up, he tries to keep personal details like sexual relations completely secret (he doesn't even like Luanne using the bathroom in his and Peggy's room). He would *never* broach the subject of intimate sexual relations with his friends - he avoids those conversations at all costs (watch the episode where Connie gets her first period for ample evidence of this aversion). \n\nHe also sees how destructive divorce can be, thanks to Bill. Hank sort of sees the value in \"ignorance is bliss\" at least when it comes to Dale. Bill at least has a steady paying military job. Dale would be homeless trying to live off of Dale's Deadbug (we're constantly reminded that Nancy is the breadwinner, and we see in the episode where Nancy goes to work in Dallas that Dale cannot take care of himself). So it's actually better for Dale to not be privy to the true father of Joseph as well. \n\nIf Hank told Dale, and Dale believed him (which is also a stretch), then it would ruin pretty much everyone's lives who are involved in it. Dale becomes homeless, Joseph is now a child of divorced parents who realizes at 13 that he's a different race than he thought, Nancy would have to deal with the publicity that would likely result from this, and John Redcorn's life as he knows it comes crashing down once he has legal guardianship over a child (no more banging sluts when he's gotta take Joseph to football practice).",

    "body": "I think the root of the frustration and hate people feel towards Arvo is the lack of choice the game gives you. From the perspective of the characters, Arvo is a known liar, clearly hostile, has tried to escape, and has tried to have your group killed. It just doesn't make sense that so many of the characters go out of their way to help him. \n\nNevertheless, despite all the actions Arvo has taken against the group, they still try to help him. Arvo responds by shooting Clem. Now I think it's important to note that depending on your choices, at the time Clem was shot she would have been completely innocent.\n\nTaking my play through as an example:\n\n* Clem didn't steal from him\n* Clem didn't attack him\n* Clem had put her gun down when she was shot.\n\nArvo shot a little unarmed girl just because he was sad? Doesn't cut it for me.\nFirst off, I don't think we can overlook the fact that Lee was talking to an 8 year old. It seemed very obvious to me that he was sugar coating it a bit.\n\nRegardless, that isn't an excuse, and there are plenty of examples out there that show Arvo was a relatively bad person. \n\nChrista had more of a reason to blame Clem for Omid's death than Arvo had a reason to blame Clem for anything. She didn't take it out on her, or shoot her, she attempted to move and even took care of Clem.\nIt is implied that Lee's crime involved people really close to him, which led to a sense of betrayal and overreaction. It's definitely bad, but not the same as Arvo.\n\nWhat I think you are forgetting is that Arvo was a terrible person BEFORE all the bad stuff happened to him, and that he took out his anger on an innocent bystander.\n\nThe entire catalyst to his shitty situation was him putting Clem's group in mortal danger based on a lie.\n\nI'd even go one step further and say Kenny was right. It seemed really obvious that Arvo was going to try and kill someone. Had the group just been reasonable and listened to Kenny to begin with, then all the deaths in E5 could have been avoided.",

    "body": "Depression as a mood and depression as a mood disorder are two different things. Many people experience periods of transient depression. This is not a disorder, but it still can be quite severe and result in self-harm or suicide. Depression as a mood disorder is persistent, and in many cases lifelong, feelings of being \"down\", inadequate, worthless, suicidal, and just generally dissatisfied with life. \nThese may be people who are experiencing transient periods of depression, these may be liars, or they may be people covering up their depression. Speaking for myself as someone who has an anxiety disorder that causes persistent depression, I was known to be quite a boisterous, friendly and upbeat person in college. Many times I was the life of a party and I had a very large group of friends among whom I was known for being excitable and happy. Then I would go to my dorm room and cry or cut myself. Neither of those things was fake either. My friends genuinely made me happy, and why would I want to bring out my depression into a situation in which I was happy? Why would I want to deliberately bring myself and others down? On top of this, I would occasionally experience manic episodes. Mania is the other pole from which bipolar disorder gets its name. Whereas depression is characterized by a lack of energy and feelings of apathy or hopelessness, mania is characterized by an overwhelming intensity of energy that can result in anxiousness and panic, often resulting in that hair-trigger anger that people imagine when they think of BPD, or if you're lucky and spending time with people you like that mania can result in a high-energy euphoria that is actually one of the best feelings I have ever experienced. One of the things that bummed me out the most when I went on medication was knowing that these euphoric episodes would go away.\n\nAnyways, hope that helped some.",

    "body": "Fully endorsing \/u\/electricfistula's great answer, and adding on.  Season 8 never felt like a final season.  So many new characters were introduced, just to be killed off.  Dr. Vogel's character, while brilliantly played by Charlotte Rampling, made no fucking sense.  Her connection to Dexter and Harry is ludicrous.  At no point in the series was she even hinted at.  To me, it was clear that the writers never envisioned this aspect of Dexter's myth when they created the show and the character, it was purely forced into place for this one season.  \n  \nThe other new characters also seemed to only be introduced to be killed so that the characters we've all come to know get to live (save Deb, who dies because of a one in a million blood clot- just so she and Dex can have one last conversation while she's in the hospital).  No other arc is closed.  Angel, Quinn, and Matthews are still in the dark about who Dexter really was.  This makes LaGuerta's death even more pointless than it already seemed.  Jamie still hasn't done anything important.  \n  \nThose things plus Dexter and Hannah turning into bumbling idiots as already pointed out turned the last season into a disaster.  The other HUGE GAPPING hole that was never addressed in either S7 or S8 was the scene in S5 where Deb walks in on Dexter and Lumen about to kill Jordan Chase (they can't see each other because of a opaque tarp) and Deb lets them go.  Suddenly Deb finds out Dexter is a serial killer and has this huge crisis of conscious.  In what universe does it make sense that the scene in the basement never comes up between the two of them???????????????",

    "body": "Dexter season eight is awful.  It is so bad, that if there were a real life Dexter his first priority would be murdering everyone responsible for the travesty of season eight.  And I weep daily that there is not a real life Dexter.\n\nI am going to mention some events from the season.  I'm not calling these \"spoilers\" because that would imply that there was something to spoil.  Instead, I'm calling these \"saviors\" because I hope it ruins the plot and saves someone else from wasting their time with this idiotic show.\n\nLets start with what a good show is.  Dexter is a \"Dark Drama\" - and what I expect from this kind of show is, in a metaphor, a killer whale.  The whale is sleek and smooth in the same way that the show should be viscerally.  The whale is dangerous and the show should take risks and push boundaries.  The whale is subtle, a four and a half ton animal swimming at thirty miles an hour under the calm surface of the water - until the whale decides to let you see his dorsal.\n\nThe archetypal scene of season eight, was the one with Hanna McKay and that private detective on the bus.  Hanna injects the detective and tells him \"I've just given you a sedative, you'll wake up in a couple hours\".  Why did she say this?  I'll go through a few possible reasons.\n\n1. The character would have?  No.  Absolutely not.  Hanna is a subtle poisoner.  Announcing on a crowded bus, and in the company of a child, that you have just poisoned someone is not only reckless and idiotic (we know how this poison works, the guy is already zonked out, she is explaining to no one), but it is also anathema to her character.  She would want to keep things quiet and secret.\n\n2. The viewer needed the exposistion?  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Someone entirely unfamiliar with the series, watching that clip on mute would have been able to tell the relevant details.  She injects the guy, he passes out, she escapes.  Yup.  Plus, the Dexter viewer is intimately familiar with how this poison works.\n\n3. The show wants to make it painfully clear that Hanna (despite being a serial killer) isn't killing the guy now that she is a love interest.  Sadly, this is the correct answer.\n\nAt this point, the show has been neutered.  Any kind of danger or risk taking in terms of plotting elements is gone.  Hanna is the good person now, only doing good things.  She would never kill anyone and the show will use retard gloves to pointless drive that into you.\n\nContrast this with the scene in Breaking Bad were Lydia comments that there is only a single packet of Stevia remaining.  This scene feels like the lurch of an unexplained ripple beneath your life raft in the midst of still waters.  Dexter season eight is like they ranked all the Dexter fanfiction that existed and then decided to film one, but they accidentally chose from the bottom of the list instead of the top.\n\nWhere once the show was clever, it became bumbling and hamfisted.  Dexter can't do anything right.  Constantly failing to kill people he should, making mistakes, never learning from his actions.  Oh, taking this boy murderer under your wing now buddy?  HOW MANY FUCKING TIMES HAS THAT FAILED FOR YOU BY NOW?  Wants to kill Hanna, can't.  Wants to kill so and so.  Can't.  Wants to blah blah blah.\n\nThe narrative is clumsy and jagged.  The motivations of characters reverse for no real reason.  Deb wants to kill Dexter all of a sudden.  Nope, changed her mind, helping him again.  Now she is dead.  Dexter wants to live with Hanna, nope now he wants to kill himself now that Deb is dead.  Nope, he survived driving his boat through a hurricane and is now a logger.  There is a dangerous brain surgeon serial killer.  Nope, he is caught.  Now free again cause Dexter can't kill him.  Now caught, nope free.  Dexter has a new love interest, nope she is dead.  And on and on and on.  How are Masuka and his daughter getting along now?  Oh she uses drugs!\n\nThe show always struggled to be plausible, but in season eight it doesn't even bother trying.  Why is Hanna staying at your sister's house?  Why doesn't she wear a fucking wig when she goes out?  Again, look at the efforts they go to in Breaking Bad to disguise themself.  Now imagine Hanna walking into a hospital with no disguise AND GIVING THE ADDRESS WHERE SHE IS CURRENTLY STAYING! Why are you getting romantically involved with a serial killer whose MO is killing her partner?  And you left your son with her?  Great thinking Dex.\n\nI didn't watch Dexter to see the bumbling misadventures of a limp dicked blood spatter analysist as he just wants to be happy with his girlfriend.  I watched it because Dexter was a cool, powerful monster in plain sight.  The story was smart and felt like it was going places.  Season eight is like a parody of Dexter that forgot that parodies were supposed to at least be funny.",

Dexter wants to live with Hanna, nope now he wants to kill himself now that Deb is dead.  Nope, he survived driving his boat through a hurricane and is now a logger.  There is a dangerous brain surgeon serial killer.  Nope, he is caught.  Now free again cause Dexter can't kill him.  Now caught, nope free.  Dexter has a new love interest, nope she is dead.  And on and on and on.  How are Masuka and his daughter getting along now?  Oh she uses drugs!\n\nThe show always struggled to be plausible, but in season eight it doesn't even bother trying.  Why is Hanna staying at your sister's house?  Why doesn't she wear a fucking wig when she goes out?  Again, look at the efforts they go to in Breaking Bad to disguise themself.  Now imagine Hanna walking into a hospital with no disguise AND GIVING THE ADDRESS WHERE SHE IS CURRENTLY STAYING! Why are you getting romantically involved with a serial killer whose MO is killing her partner?  And you left your son with her?  Great thinking Dex.\n\nI didn't watch Dexter to see the bumbling misadventures of a limp dicked blood spatter analysist as he just wants to be happy with his girlfriend.  I watched it because Dexter was a cool, powerful monster in plain sight.  The story was smart and felt like it was going places.  Season eight is like a parody of Dexter that forgot that parodies were supposed to at least be funny.",

    "body": "People in the DC universe are absurdly resilent. Criminals are regularly thrown through windows and walls without any lasting harm. Ordinary civilians and bystanders can jump higher, run faster, and take more punishment than a normal human would be able to. For instance, Batman, an ordinary human at peak physical health, runs faster than Usain Bolt, regularly lifts more than the human world record, and recovers from injuries faster than should be humanly possible. The DC human brain is probably more shock-resistant than a normal human brain.\n\nIn Batman begins, Batman had every intention of having Gordon blow up the train tower which would cause the train to crash, and every intention of leaving Ra's al Ghul there to die. He said he wasn't killing him, he just wasn't saving him. That's just the same as Batman pulling the trigger on a gun and saying \"I am not killing you, the bullet is\". He made the plan, and executed it, knowing Ra's al Ghul would die.\n\nYou forget the point of Batman's no-kill rule. It isn't an arbitrary requirement he throws on himself for no reason. The no-kill rule is simply to hold himself back in the absence of public accountability, legal restrictions, or responsible partners (Robin is a kid. He doesn't count). When the cops fought Bane or when Gordon blew up the train tower, there were other people in the plot to ensure that Batman wasn't murdering out of petty revenge. The Batman can only kill out of absolute self-defense or under the eye of others to prevent himself from being the next Two-Face, Rorschach, or Ozymandias.",

What's more sympathetic than that?\n\nAs far as my own personal love for the book, I can tell you that when I read it as a teenager, I had an epiphany-like experience of feeling like someone else in the world might actually understand me.  I was neglected, I was mentally ill and not getting treatment, and when Holden said it was the kind of cold where you felt like you were going to disappear every time you crossed the street, I thought *\"Oh my God, somebody GETS me.\"*\n\nThis book isn't for everyone, but for some people it is a profoundly validating experience.  Maybe you didn't suffer in the same way as Holden when you were a child.  Maybe you have a different kind of coping strategy, a different kind of resilience.  But Holden's voice is so true to how so many of us feel, when we read that book we feel as if J.D. Salinger has reached out and held our hand.",

It's hard to read either account without noting that Wilson did not make it clear to the men what was taking place before initiating the altercation. Wilson had yelled from his window for the two to stop walking in the street, and was upset when they didn't immediately change course. He reversed to them, tried to open his door, but it shut back on him because he didn't have room to open it. So, Wilson grabbed Brown by the neck from his window and started lecturing him, though no one is sure of their conversation, this is when the scuffle started.\n\nThis cop didn't use his speaker or lights or follow any normal police procedures to let these guys know what was going on. I don't dispute that Brown scared him at some point, but he approached this in a way that escalates situations, not defuses them as police are trained to do.

Obviously, cops are the same because criminals and autists function on the same level and officers always have backup ready.\" What you propose is laughable because you seem to value life for no apparent reason. Situation come up where it is more convenient to kill someone than to risk getting hurt or killed. If you can't accept that then maybe you should lead by example and try to physically restrain a criminal that is intent on killing you.",

We are in a great place and are getting married in October. \n\nLast night I went to my best friend's birthday party. My fiance is out of town til Tuesday. I arrived around 1030pm after pre-gaming with two other friends, so when I arrived I was pretty sloshed. I remember arriving. \n\nI also remember running into a girl, we'll call Mandy, I had known in high school. We had dated briefly and she was my first blowjob back then. Anyway. We caught up and all that, and I remember her being particularly flirty. I told her I was engaged and even showed her pictures of my fiance. Then, I went about my night. I remember my best friend pulling me aside and told me that Mandy was wanting to hook up with me, and was overly flirty. I was honestly pretty oblivious of her advances. \n\nAnyway, I kept drinking. Took several shots of Southern Comfort, and eventually blacked out. The only thing I remember after that is a quick flash of me vomiting out in the back yard. But something else happened. \n\nMy best friend said he walked upstairs to grab a towel, because someone had thrown up in his kitchen. When he opened the door, apparently Mandy was giving me a blowjob. I was apparently just lying there, looked like I was asleep. In his drunken state, he didn't think much of it, so he shut the door. \n\nI woke up the next morning around 7am, alone. My pants were completely off, and I still had my shirt on. I found out later from my best friend he overheard Mandy on her way out telling someone we had sex. I was completely blacked out, probably even passed out. I was definitely raped.\n\nI don't know what to tell my fiance. I'm trying to keep it under wraps. I'm afraid she won't believe I was raped. What do I do?\n\n**TL;DR** I was raped by an old flame at my friend's party. I have a fiance and I'm afraid of telling her in fear she won't believe me.\n\nEdit 1: Just called my fiance, told her I had something I wanted to talk to her about and not to worry. I just didn't want to pretend everything was normal til Tuesday. She is coming home early and will be back tomorrow evening. I've worried her, and now I'm even more afraid to tell her...\n\nEdit 2: Thank you everyone for your support. I'm still incredibly worried about telling my fiance. But it's gotta happen. I will post an update tomorrow night if I can. Honestly, I'm more worried about losing my love than I am hurt that it happened. I don't think I will need counseling, I'm a pretty level headed and rational person. NOT that people who do need counseling aren't! Just for me, personally, I don't think it would help much. Just a personal preference. Everybody copes differently. \n\nEdit 3: I just talk to my best friend. We both agree, it definitely appears I was raped. He says the more he think about it, the more he thought I was asleep or passed out when she was blowing me. He apologized for not stopping it, but was so drunk he just didn't think anything of it. He's willing to talk to my fiance is she needs proof. Also he is going to try and talk to Mandy soon. He's just thinking of a way to do it tactfully. I will also update with how that goes.\n\n[Source](http:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/sex\/comments\/2423ao\/i_was_raped_last_night_im_engaged_im_a_man\/)",

I will also update with how that goes.\n\n[Source](http:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/sex\/comments\/2423ao\/i_was_raped_last_night_im_engaged_im_a_man\/)",

A had already asserted their intentions, and B theirs. They conflicted yet A has ignored this.\n\nFurther evidence is that, while B wakes up unable to form words or thoughts, A is already up and driving. This indicates enough disparity between their drunkeness that A is entirely culpable for what happened.\n\nMaybe if sober A wouldn't have done it. But do we excuse men who hit their wives only when drunk? Or people who murder under the influence of crazy drugs? No, A's state does not impact the fact they committed a crime.",

    "body": "Another good example of things mattering is Chevy's goodbye episode - the polygraph episode. It was similar to Intro to Felt Surrogacy in that each character had secrets that would upset the others and all those secrets were put on the table throughout the episode. In Felt Surrogacy, the secrets they each hold are of very different magnitudes. Troy started a 50 acre fire, while Jeff bailed on a date and felt bad about it. Everyone treats their secrets as if they have the same weight to them, and at the end they have a very sappy \"aww, we can all feel better about this now\" moment. In Cooperative Polygraphy each person's secret is given the appropriate weight. There character's secrets aren't just about things they did, but things they did to each other. There isn't a final moment of sappy sitcom closure where all the harm is undone and everyone hugs. Instead they grow as people. They realize that they're not as nice as they all might think of themselves being. Things mattered this time around.",

I'm not saying go along with it just because he wants to, but try to understand why he wants to, and realize that this is a decision you are making together, which really adds to the relationship.\n\n2)  Holy shit that cat is sa-weeeeet!

See they don't have fur, and people are allergic to chemicals in cat dander, which is spread all over by the fur, when they're petter or whatever.

    "body": "Hi there, I'm happy to hear that you help out those animals that need loving homes and while not ready to get a Sphynx cat, are at least open-minded about it.\n\nSo I'm gonna lay out the benefits and ignore the costs (related to care and such) that I'm sure you are aware of them with your cat experiences.\n\n1) Your *Boo-Bear*\n\nYeah, I'm talking about your boyfriend, I'm not sure what you call each other, so I'm gonna roll with that.  Your Boo-Bear, for whatever reason, thinks that he wants a sphynx cat.  While your statement above is unclear, I am going to assume that he has experience with cats as well.  Now I would recommend that you ask him why he wants this particular type, and what he thinks of the cuddly issue.  But, remember that there is always the added benefit of, as long as you talk about it and do it together, making your Boo-Bear happy.  I'm not saying go along with it just because he wants to, but try to understand why he wants to, and realize that this is a decision you are making together, which really adds to the relationship.\n\n2)  Holy shit that cat is sa-weeeeet!  First off, its distinct!  Your friends will be like \"woah! that's the coolest cat ever! So unique!\"  It stands up proud like its not gonna take shit from nobody!  Also, its basically a God!  The Egyptians worshipped em, its even named for a mythical creature of incredible intelligence.  Hell, the Egyptians were so terrified of those things that during the Battle of Pelusium, the Persian Cambyses II released hundreds of 'em and the Egyptian refused to fight, lest they harm their Cat-God.  Persians killed em where they stood! That cat helped conquer nations, can a tabby say that?\n\n2) Now its disputed but they may be better for people with allergies.  See they don't have fur, and people are allergic to chemicals in cat dander, which is spread all over by the fur, when they're petter or whatever.  But this ain't got none of those little allergy missiles!  So while the allergy problem isn't TOTALLY gone, it is reduced.  Now you can make friends with the lesser-folk!\n\n3)  ANYTHING can be cuddly!  My friend has porcupine he carries everywhere!  His roommate sleeps with his snake wrapped all around him!  He even just got a badass tarantula that sits on his shoulder!  See, you just need to appreciate your pet, and to accept it for what it has to offer!  Look here: http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/Qsrl3\nSee, \"cuddly\" is a frame of mind!\n\nDisclaimer:  I am by no means an expert on cats or any other living organism for that matter.  Please consult the breeder, veterinarians, etc., for the REAL advice.\n\nI hope this helps!",

    "body": "I went to and worked at the same camp for 11 years. From my understanding (and experience), camp is almost purely a social experience. When you are young, it is a social experience where you learn how to become friends with children of your own sex without the aid of your parents. As you get older, it is a social experience befriending (and other activities...) people of the opposite sex. I don't know if this makes camp all about \"acceptance,\" but it definitely makes the camp owners want to foster a friendly environment.\n\nIn regards to pranks, at my camp they used to be condoned; however, the pranks progressed year after year, become more and more vagrant (for lack of a better word). When my camp switched owners, the first year of under new ownership, a particularly ridiculous prank occurred (I wouldn't even call it a prank; some idiots stole candy from the Canteen). It was the owner's first year so he just put out a zero tolerance policy towards pranks and the lot. People still do them, but they are much smaller and more discreet than before. \n\nIn regards to protecting kids, I think a camp should foster a safe environment, especially for younger children. By age 12, most parents are okay if their children get hurt at camp (i.e. when they would get a call from the camp, they would say it happens), but for younger children (ages 8-11) parents were very scared whenever they heard their children were hurt. This is understandable and I this is why I accept trying to make camp a safe environment. At these young ages, camp is literally all about the activities to the kids; when they are older, camp is about the friendships and relationships they make. If the focal point of camp for these younger children doesn't appear safe to a parent considering sending their child there, then the camp would be failing one of its goals. \n\nThat's at least what I think about it anyway.",

I was at a show while recovering from back surgery (I was far enough recovered that I wasn't at serious risk from someone lightly bumping into me, but I didn't want to be in the middle of an aggressive pit for obvious reasons). I was standing to the outside of the crowd purposefully to avoid being in the pit, and was pushed into a pit by the people around me. I ended up fucking up my back and having issues walking for about a week afterwards. I did not volunteer to be in that pit, I did not stand too close to it for it to be my fault. Not everybody who finds themselves in a pit wants to be there. As well, when some asshole cold clocks you in the face (which happened to me in another pit) it stands to reason that you're going to be pissed. And I would imagine the majority of people you see whining or complaining fall into one of those two categories - over aggressive assholes pushing you into a pit, or over aggressive assholes hurting you on purpose in said pit.\n\nAnd to clarify, I have been in many pits willingly, and have enjoyed the majority of those occasions.

In addition to anime, there's things like Tad Williams' *Otherland* series and, *Fate\/Extra* and, of course, *The Matrix*.\nI'm not clear on how SAO's premise is different.  You say that there's less focus on horror (meaning violent death?) or on gaming aspects, but that's the case for many of the other stories that use this idea.  What you're left with is \"people from contemporary Earth are transported to a sword-and-sorcery world\", which is [even more cliche](http:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/TrappedInAnotherWorld).",

And in several places either Asuna, or one of his other female companions (including a 6 yr old girl), saves his sorry ass from being killed. \n\nAnd while Asuna was placed in captivity in season 2, the lead female role was replaced by Kirito's sister, who is in no way helpless at all, who [SPOILER] saves his life at the end. \n\nFinally, in season 3 (the gun-game), he teams up with a sniper-girl suffering to overcome her PTSD. \n\nBasically, I'm trying to say that the notion of female disempowerment in the SAO argument is rooted in (1) a misunderstanding of common anime and MMO video game themes and mechanics and (2) ignoring all the counter examples.",

Her campaign was run purely on hopes and dreams, and more than a few politicians have seen the end of their careers when they failed to deliver those.  Failure of this magnitude is a justifiable reason to seek a change in president, regardless of how realistic the goal is.\nThis is an illogical response, one born of emotion rather than reason.  Understandable, but not justifiable.  They are offering badly needed aid, that you arguably may not survive without.  It could be suicide to dismiss them, meeting them with violence could be costly, and trusting them explicitly would be unwise.  Therefore the rational solution is to accept their aid, but monitor them closely and limit their movement until you can be sure of their trustworthiness.  I believe that Adama satisfied these conditions in the initial standoff when they arrived.  Their interaction with the fleet was limited, and Galactica positioned itself with a lethal response ready at all times until their trust was earned by way of the testimony of trusted allies and deeds done by the Cylons.  Even then Adama was reluctant, but was pressed by circumstance to accept them.  Mind you, this is how they handled Athena when she returned with Helo.\nVery true.  At that point, their government bore little resemblance to a democracy and looked much more like a dictatorship, though I would argue this was necessary given the fragility of the fleet and responsibilities of its admiral.  Despite it's deeply negative stigma and undemocratic nature, martial law is not without its merits when used responsibly.\n\nNow here comes the part where I disagree with you- mutiny was not the answer.

Then again Lesnar wasn't exactly in perfect condition either, and many considered Ali past his prime even post suspension.  He certainly looked less fit.  Then again look what Couture, Foreman, and Hopkins have accomplished at older ages.",

He needs to be punished for his incompetence. \nPlease don't assume you know what I base my position on, I very mixed emotions on the entire thing and have gone back and forth on my position. And how the media spun it had really no affect on me. One guy is dead and the other guy life is probably ruined. Both could have and should have made better decisions, however one was an adult, the other was a kid. \n\nYou should really refrain from calling TM a thug, racist, street fighter, drug dealer etc..  Ultimately with the facts on your side it those things should not matter one bit, it could have been the Pope and it would have been justified. \nGZ has a history of his own.",

He was heading back to his truck, and there is evidence of this.  Stop making shit up.\nRight... so you cannot assert in any way that Zimmerman started it. That goes in his favor.  We can only rule on the evidence, and the evidence shows a thug on top of zimmerman beating the shit out of him.  Any reasonable person would respond with force in this scenario.  Remember you have to prove he is guilty. He doesnt have to prove his innocence, that is the default.\n\nLOL no its not.  You need to look up the legal definition.   \nFor fucks sake you cant just make up the definition of shit moron.  Its not negligent to shoot someone beating the shit out of you.   \n\nIts amazing how you have to pathetically make shit up and twist the definitions of everything to try and prove zimmerman is guilty. \n\nZimmerman was in the middle of a fight where he got his nose broken and head smashed into the concrete by a larger athletic younger man who had him in a mounted position raining strikes down at him.\n\nWhat would a cop do in this scenario?   Oh yeah... fucking shoot you.  Which is exactly what a citizen should do to defend themselves too.   Doesnt even matter who started the fight.   You are required by law to stop attacking someone the moment you can.   Clearly thug Martin didnt stop attacking and get off of zimmerman from a mounted position while he screamed for help, so he got his ass shit.   He got shot due to his own poor thug decisions.",

    "body": "If we believe Zimmerman's statements, and the police as well as a jury found no apparent reason not to, Zimmerman did not know Martin's race when he began following him. What attracted Zimmerman's attention was a man wearing a hood walking between houses at night, in a neighborhood that had been troubled by burglaries.\n\nLets put this another way. Is there any actual evidence to suggest that Zimmerman is a racist? This seems to be an assertion that's being made between the lines without any real support. \nSadly, yes. I'd say it's conditional: an older, clean-cut black man wearing a suit? No. A young black man wearing certain kinds of fashion, sporting tattoos and gold teeth? Yes. Is that racist? I'd argue no. Is it a form of prejudice? That's arguable - clothing and manner of dress are used for a variety of reasons, but one being to signify a certain set of beliefs and values, an adherence to a certain social \"code\". \n\nThe fact is that inner city\/ghetto culture in this country has rightfully earned a reputation for thuggish behavior. It isn't George Zimmerman's fault that if you open a hip-hop club in a city, even in a nice neighborhood, you have to pay for ten times more security and still deal with a higher frequency of fights and gang activity. That's just a fact, and we can either own up to it and figure out how to deal with it, or we can go off into some hippie-dippy la-la land of ignorant political correctness. It isn't a matter of skin color, it's a matter of cultural mores and values promulgated by different quarters of society. But it is an important matter that needs to be addressed: the epidemic of violence in the inner city is claiming a lot of lives, and costing a lot more their livelihoods. If we really care about our children and our countrymen, we will summon up the courage to stop looking for scapegoats and face up to this serious problem. Trayvon Martin, who by all accounts knocked a guy onto the ground and then continued beating him mercilessly, is a sad victim of this culture, as are *so many* young black men and women. Look at the homicide rates in Chicago, look at the faces of the victims. Look at the perpetrators... it's not a bunch of George Zimmermans.\n\nI feel tremendous sympathy for the kid's family. I feel tremendous sympathy for the kid himself... he could be so many kids I grew up with, called friend, ate dinner with. We've all made mistakes, and you and I, dear reader, are still here to talk about it, able to learn from them and carry on with our lives. Sadly, Trayvon isn't still with us, and will never have that opportunity to learn from mistakes. He didn't deserve that fate. \n\nBut the reality is that George Zimmerman is not ultimately to blame for his fate... George Zimmerman had no other choice, if we take a rational reading of events. Anyone who says they would passively lay there and let themselves be pinned to the ground and beaten into unconsciousness or worse on the street is either lying or hopelessly naive, and probably both. What's to blame for Trayvon's fate is a culture that teaches our young men that they are not men unless they solve their problems with violence, that respect is synonymous with beating people up, and using your words and your head instead of your fists is cowardly, and that running away from a meaningless confrontation is a shameful act rather than a wise one. It's a fate that will continue to befall an unfortunate number of us, and disproportionately those of us who are black or poor or from the 'hood, until we steel ourselves to confronting the real problem.",

What attracted Zimmerman's attention was a man wearing a hood walking between houses at night, in a neighborhood that had been troubled by burglaries.\n\nLets put this another way. Is there any actual evidence to suggest that Zimmerman is a racist? This seems to be an assertion that's being made between the lines without any real support. \nSadly, yes. I'd say it's conditional: an older, clean-cut black man wearing a suit? No. A young black man wearing certain kinds of fashion, sporting tattoos and gold teeth? Yes. Is that racist? I'd argue no.

It isn't George Zimmerman's fault that if you open a hip-hop club in a city, even in a nice neighborhood, you have to pay for ten times more security and still deal with a higher frequency of fights and gang activity. That's just a fact, and we can either own up to it and figure out how to deal with it, or we can go off into some hippie-dippy la-la land of ignorant political correctness. It isn't a matter of skin color, it's a matter of cultural mores and values promulgated by different quarters of society. But it is an important matter that needs to be addressed: the epidemic of violence in the inner city is claiming a lot of lives, and costing a lot more their livelihoods. If we really care about our children and our countrymen, we will summon up the courage to stop looking for scapegoats and face up to this serious problem.

He was placed in a high stress situation and it isn't unreasonable that he could have thought trayvon was reaching for his gun for whatever reason. In hindsight, this might not have been true but self-defense claims don't require him to have perfect knowledge of the situation.",

I'm sorry, when someone is following me at night, for no reason, I'm fearing my safety, and I will defend myself. \n\nZimmerman will get at least manslaughter for creating a situation that caused anyone to fear for his life, not creating a narrative, just stating how most people would feel under the circumstances. Neighborhood watch people around the country will think it's alright to initiate confrontations, then claim self defense after murdering innocent people if Zimmerman walks.",

    "body": "The 'initiation of encounter' itself doesn't justify anything. Martin's state of mind on being followed matters. Did he think his life was in danger? Of course, unfortunately, Martin is dead so we can't ask him. Hence, there's a real question for the Jury to decide. But just because Zimmerman 'initiated' the encounter doesn't *in itself* justify his guilt. \nThe dispatcher told zimmerman that he doesn't need to follow martin. He wasn't 'directly ordered'. Furthermore, it's questionable whether dispatcher can issue authoritative commands.",

Brewer (a store clerk who said he saw Oswald acting suspicious) was the one who reported him, not for not paying for the movie, but rather for acting suspicious. Given that the POTUS (And a cop) were just shot, sending 20 cops wouldn't be unheard of.\n\n5) Actually if you shoot a large hard sphere filled with goo on the inside, the result is that the object will come back at you. \n\nexample here: http:\/\/youtu.be\/iSg6XwXe6WQ?t=26m53s\n\nAnd my main point is... there is 0 evidence of any other shooter. Nothing. Absolutely no solid evidence.",

Broly isn't part of it, and Baby\/DBZ GT is out.\n\nWhat we *do* have is a huge theme and one single direct line, given by Goku: *The greater the opponent, the more I rise up.* (or something to that effect). In other words, he matches new challenges. \n\nIf you take a look at the Saiyans, they were all weaker than Frieza's main henchmen until Goku and Vegeta started 'rising up to meet the challenge' on a one-on-one basis against each other and against enemies like Pui Pui, Dodoria, Zarbon, and then the Ginyu Force. Every single one of these fights ended in severe injury and near death, but then an opportunity for Zenkai followed.\n\nThere's a small window of opportunity in a race that gets stronger in response to challenges. If the enemy is too weak, then there's no advancement; if the enemy is too strong, the Saiyan just dies.\n\nThus, Goku and Vegeta (and their children) are not exceptions to the rule at all, but rather extremely lucky to progressively face tougher foes on a step by step one-on-one basis.\n\nYou can see this window of opportunity *being missed* when Vegeta powers up after the Ginyu Force fight and is able to match first-form Frieza. Frieza transforms and gets stronger, and Vegeta simply loses. He survives with Dende's healing, and would be able to match second and third form Frieza for sure - but he fails again! Because Frieza's final form is just too strong. This is how most Saiyans would meet their end. He just happens to be revived by the Dragonballs later.\n\nSo the Saiyan race would not have simply all continued to get stronger to the point of threatening the universe. A great many of them would have gotten in fights over their heads and died; more would have picked on weaker races and failed to advance. Only a very small number of procedurally lucky fighters advance to levels like Goku and Vegeta.\n\nIn fact, Goku and Vegeta's luck ran out. They both died at various points. It's only the Dragonballs that are truly responsible for continuing their step-by-step slightly-stronger-enemy faceoffs. What we witness in DBZ is a race's tragic cultural flaw getting them into fights over their capabilities until they all get killed. Fighting people stronger than you is a Saiyan's best opportunity for advancement *and* greatest risk. Eventually, your luck runs out, and Saiyans were culturally bred to just be okay with that fact.\n\nFrieza couldn't count on luck, though.

I did the same things--the acting strangely, the telling good friends I had a crush on x, etc etc etc. I also remember obsessing about the crush object and imagining out all sorts of weird narrative scenarios where I have to rescue them or we both realize we're in love through some improbable situation. Strangely at the time it felt a lot like a medieval courtly love, like abelard and heloise--a feeling of intense devotion and obsession, the sense that material signs of love like kissing or dates would \"ruin\" it. So in that sense I agree with you, I think. I even worked up the nerve to tell one girl I liked her in 7th grade, after spending months building up to it, and when I finally did she said \"yeah, I know\" and my mind went blank and I had literally NO IDEA what to do next. Nothing happened and we continued being normal friends. \n\nBut even now (I'm 25 now) and I can get sort of obsessive about certain girls in the same way--just idealizing them and thinking about how great they are all the time and how they complete me. It's a mode of attraction which makes for a lot of unrequited love and, also, makes me act like an ass. This happens ESPECIALLY if I wait a really long time to make a move on someone I like. The way I see it, a crush is like an investment of hope. You dump some imagination into what it would like to be with that person, and then that image feeds you a certain shining. Even though it can slow action, because the reality of what that idealized person actually IS breaks through the illusion which sustains you for so long. ANYWAYS this is all to say while you're right that children don't have any sexual component to their crushes, the fantasy and imagination to evoke romantic feelings can still work. Kids develop those kinds of feelings early on through parental behavior, through culture, etc etc etc. What do you think?",

    "body": "An eight year old boy says \"When I grow up, I want to be an astronaut.\"\n\nOf course, from his perspective, he genuinely means it. He's seen an astronaut in a movie, maybe, and thinks it looks cool. He has no actual understanding of what an astronaut does, or how rigid and dangerous is. He has no idea that when he turns 12 he's going to discover how much he  actually hates the boring work of astronomy and physics, and that he's not really into working out and prefers writing poetry. By the time he's an adult, being an astronaut is the LAST thing he wants to be.\n\nBut that doesn't mean it's not 'genuine' when he said it as a kid. Kids are nothing if not genuine. What it means is that he said it in the way kids say all things: uninformed, mostly emotional, imitating adult behaviors and media depictions with little real understanding. From his perspective, he really does want to be an astronaut, and from an adult perspective, we know that's cute precisely because it's such a child's understanding of the world; that's why we say \"Awww\".\n\nChildhood crushes are the same way. Of course they're absolutely nothing like adult crushes. Of course kids have none of the vital information (like, say, their sexual preferences) that will shape their adult desires. A childhood crush is much more like \"play\", but to kids, play has all the emotional weight of real action. It's incredibly different from an adult crush, but that doesn't make it false or worse, lying to oneself.",

What is a finale that you found highly satisfying?\n\nThere are a couple reasons why these never live up to expectations.\n\n1) Once a show gets big, showrunners and the network are in a tug of war over how long it should continue.  Showrunners tend to want to end the show more quickly and efficiently, whereas the network wants to drag things out (because more episodes creates more money).  Breaking Bad is a good example of this.  You have the main antagonist (Gus) killed off in season 4, but there is still more airtime to fill, so the show has to build up a whole new (less intense and shorter) story with the White Power guys.  No finale in which Walt confronts the White Power guys could have been as powerful as the end of Gus.\n\nRelated to this is the Chekov's gun problem.  If you hang a gun on the wall in Act 1, someone has to fire it by Act 3.  As shows get dragged on in unnatural ways, especially shows with commercial breaks, you need to write in lots of cliffhangers, which often involve introducing new dimensions to the story (see: Lost).  This can easily get away for you and you end up leaving a bunch of loose threads or create continuity errors (see: Lost).  Breaking Bad ties up pretty much every plot and prop point though (i.e., the ricin).   \n\n2) Classically, narratives have a certain structure: rising action, climax, falling action, denouement (reflection).  In serial TV, the big problem is that everyone wants the finale to be a huge, blockbuster episode.  But, it isn't supposed to be.  You are supposed to have the huge climax sometime before the last hour of a 40+ hour story.  Really, the last episode should be pretty calm and character-driven (think everything in Lord of The Rings after they drop the ring in the mountain).    \n\nBreaking Bad actually dealt with falling action and denouement better than most shows.  You have the showdown in Ozymandias with Hank and, then a few episodes of Walt reflecting in New Hampshire.  But because the finale needs to have some sort of major climactic event, the show needed to build in the whole White Power showdown.  Basically, it is a very tough needle to thread, and Breaking Bad probably did it better than most.  Sopranos didn't even try.",

A lot of times the more successful didn't have more luck than others, but they were able to better take advantage of the luck they had.",

The only reason you know about the Trayvon ones is because it extends beyond the black community, which you are clearly not a part of.\nSo you don't believe in self defense? Interesting. A dude is following you around. You don't know why. Maybe he's trying to rob you. Maybe he's trying to hurt you. How was Trayvon supposed to know this guy following him wasn't going to jack him up and steal his wallet? Just because he's not black? Zimmerman was invading Trayvon's space and profiling him and following him around. I'd be really sketched out and concerned if that was happening to me.\n\nYou have no way of knowing Trayvon put his hands on Zimmerman \"because he thought he deserved a beat down.\" That phrasing also postures it as if Trayvon were following Zimmerman around, which was not the case.\n\nI agree this case has been twisted and the media should keep their nose out of this and all cases in my opinion.

It was no different. we had some \"space\" themed classes that some people just dicked their way through, some payed attention too and others just used the time to flirt and mock other members of the group.\n\nI don't know where you fit in your own schools clique circle. I don't know how you would have handled it, but i was a nerdy kid, not an ostracized one, and it was a waste of time and money.\n\nthe education was geared towards an average grade level of 9 or so (i was in 7th grade at the time, most of the people attending where about my age or older) the \"experience space training\" was basically rides we could only go on twice.\n\nthe gravity jumper, [was basically bungee cords](https:\/\/c2.staticflickr.com\/4\/3415\/3662223830_0b449f357c_z.jpg?zz=1)\n\n [the orbitron is something you can ride at most state fairs in texas](http:\/\/www.allaboutent.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/gyroscope-ride.jpg)\n\n the accelerator training was a [centrifugal force ride](http:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/_64wjUxIOxTc\/TNAuIK0CqZI\/AAAAAAAAAUA\/AjHjkse2HSI\/s400\/Carnival+Zero+Gravity+Centrifugal+Force+Full+Circle.png) except not as fun. \n\n\nwe met astronaughts and went to a space museum, they showed us a pee\/human waste catcher and played a \"prank\" by asking us to examine it and rub it against our faces, touch and smell it before telling us it was used to catch poo and pee.\n\nobviously the cool kids used this to mock everyone else, even though we all did it\n\nwe were not aloud in the scuba tank, but watched actual astronought trainees in it, we ate space food (which sucked) for 10 days\n\nwhen i went home, i told my parents it was great.\n\neven as a child i felt it was a terrible waste of money and time.\n\n\n\nI feel the one in Florida at least was a money making opportunity, not something that would benefit the people attending. we were part of a group of 50 over 10 days or so. (maybe 7 days of camp) with a total of about 8 from my own school.\n\nwe spent a few days in a hotel resolt and mall, i spent that time in a nearby arcade with little supervision. I thought that was the best part of the whole thing. \n\n\nMaybe mine was particularly poorly run. I still have a coat and a badge from the experience. first hand, personal experience, it was a waste of effort and money and the more i think of it the more i am convinced the school got a kickback or something for organizing and trip to the camp.\n\ni believe mine took place in november, just as it was getting cold, so maybe we got the B team, maybe we were the B team. \n\n\n\ni don't know if this would convince you, but as i kid, before i begged and pleaded and gave up allowances for 2 months to prove i wanted to go. and i regretted it deeply after.\n\ni don't care anymore. but jeeez, what a goddam waste. \n\n\ntl:dr - waste of money, a camp with a few carnival rides that was less educational than any given math, science or skill specific camp. difference is the branding and the cost. there is no increase in value, only on cost. if this was a \"i should have gone to camp. maybe, but i should have gone to space camp. it has the same logo as my nasa camp did, i suspect it was the same thing.   no added value.",
