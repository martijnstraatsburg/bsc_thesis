    "body": "I think the main reason they avoided that card is because they knew Zimmerman was not a racist.\nIt *is* hard to tell, sure.  We'll never know.  But in white+white cases, where a competent defence is presented regarding a self-defence claim of not guilty, you just don't see guilty. \n\nNothing about the event, about Martin's criminal history, or about the forensics suggests that Martin did not initiate an *apparently* violent attack against Zimmerman.\n\nWe know that:\n\n1. Both parties were on edge\n\n2. Martin had an opportunity to leave the scene, but did not (this piece may not have been related, but can be meaningful in aggregate)\n\n3. Martin had Zimmerman pinned to the ground with Zimmerman having a head wound at the time of the shooting.\n\nOf course, 3 is the big one unless someone has a *strong* argument that Zimmerman escalated physical assault.  An out-of-shape guy was in a position he probably could not escape from, having received the first of (what could have been many, or could not have been any more) wounds that would have a good chance of permanently injuring or killing him.\n\nThat's such an overwhelming amount of reasonable doubt that only a terrible defence couldn't get one person on a jury.  The police didn't seem to *want* to arrest, the DA didn't seem to *want* to prosecute.  There's a good reason.  They had to know the odds were slim and that they could not prosecute later if new evidence came out.  Nothing is worse than having your hand forced when you know that's the end of the game.\n\nI think you're focusing a lot on the unarmed 17 year old... a jury would be focused on the unarmed 17 year old on TOP of an out-of-shape old guy slamming his head in the ground... and then the judge would speak to them and tell them repeatedly about \"reasonable doubt\".  He would repeat \"reasonable doubt\" until the first reasonable doubt led people to go \"oh, shit...that's reasonable doubt\"\n\nA key part of your belief is that there were assumptions made of him being dangerous.  How could anyone portray anyone else on top of a guy slamming his head into the ground as NOT dangerous?  Further, while he did not have a criminal record, he would be extremely easy to paint as a criminal, from his violent/angry photographs to the *reasons* of his suspension from high school.  \n\nThen, look at stuff like this [picture](http://axiomamnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/martin-zimmerman-case-trayvons-body-crime-scene.png).  The jury did.  The jury also (presumably) heard that Martin bragged about being a repeat violent offender so much that his own mother thought he was arrested when he was 5-hours late from 7/11.\n\nIf you've got testimony that supports \"I beat the shit out of people who look at me wrong\" and suddenly that person is shot while on to of a wounded man with no violent history, and there are no good witnesses... if the story matches the forensics, and there's no compelling evidence, the guy walks.",

It was simpler, more in your face etc.  Now that type of humor isn't bad, a lot of people like it, but part of why i liked community in the first place was the humor.  changing that to me makes it noticeably worse.  \n\nlastly i'll just briefly mention the tone.  a lot of it seemed more light heart-ed and not as heavy as some of the other seasons.  i remember episode one abed said \"that's the nicest thing anybody's ever said to me\" after jeff said \"i see your value now\"  while it sounds funny at first that is some dark shit.  i don't remember anything like this from the fourth season.  this might just be my selective memory of the earlier seasons at the time though.  \n\nnow there were things they did that i think were better than all the other seasons, but overall my view of it is less than the others.",

He got wildly drunk under this perfectly reasonable expectation, and the fact that this expectation was not met is entirely the fault of the old flame. \n\nFurthermore, he tried to show the old flame that he was not interested: he went so far as to show her pictures of his fiancee. If anyone should have refrained from alcohol, it was the old flame, as perhaps she knew that were she to be drunk and find him compromised, she would have a difficult time resisting taken advantage. But that's all on her, not on him. \n\nOne way to think about it is the example of people who wear clothes that can be called provocative. Even if this does increase the likelihood that they'll be raped (I don't know whether it does or not), they are not to blame in the least if they are raped. It's the same situation here: increasing the likelihood that you'll be raped does not make you at fault. Would you say someone walking around a dangerous area was to blame for being murdered?",

    "body": "hello friend, i went to nasa camp.\n\nIt was based in florida, it occured in the 1980's\n\ni do not now recall if it was an official nasa thing, dad is dead, mom would say it was official no matter what.\n\nwe did a lot of space things, we did see some official rockets, we were on an official nasa campus.\n\nit was a terrible waste of money.\n\nI don't know what space camp is like, but Nasa camp was a continuation of high school, the cool kids and athletes had their representatives, the nerds and the ostracized had theirs. It was no different. we had some \"space\" themed classes that some people just dicked their way through, some payed attention too and others just used the time to flirt and mock other members of the group.\n\nI don't know where you fit in your own schools clique circle. I don't know how you would have handled it, but i was a nerdy kid, not an ostracized one, and it was a waste of time and money.\n\nthe education was geared towards an average grade level of 9 or so (i was in 7th grade at the time, most of the people attending where about my age or older) the \"experience space training\" was basically rides we could only go on twice.\n\nthe gravity jumper, [was basically bungee cords](https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3415/3662223830_0b449f357c_z.jpg?zz=1)\n\n [the orbitron is something you can ride at most state fairs in texas](http://www.allaboutent.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/gyroscope-ride.jpg)\n\n the accelerator training was a [centrifugal force ride](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_64wjUxIOxTc/TNAuIK0CqZI/AAAAAAAAAUA/AjHjkse2HSI/s400/Carnival+Zero+Gravity+Centrifugal+Force+Full+Circle.png) except not as fun. \n\n\nwe met astronaughts and went to a space museum, they showed us a pee/human waste catcher and played a \"prank\" by asking us to examine it and rub it against our faces, touch and smell it before telling us it was used to catch poo and pee.\n\nobviously the cool kids used this to mock everyone else, even though we all did it\n\nwe were not aloud in the scuba tank, but watched actual astronought trainees in it, we ate space food (which sucked) for 10 days\n\nwhen i went home, i told my parents it was great.\n\neven as a child i felt it was a terrible waste of money and time.\n\n\n\nI feel the one in Florida at least was a money making opportunity, not something that would benefit the people attending. we were part of a group of 50 over 10 days or so. (maybe 7 days of camp) with a total of about 8 from my own school.\n\nwe spent a few days in a hotel resolt and mall, i spent that time in a nearby arcade with little supervision. I thought that was the best part of the whole thing. \n\n\nMaybe mine was particularly poorly run. I still have a coat and a badge from the experience. first hand, personal experience, it was a waste of effort and money and the more i think of it the more i am convinced the school got a kickback or something for organizing and trip to the camp.\n\ni believe mine took place in november, just as it was getting cold, so maybe we got the B team, maybe we were the B team. \n\n\n\ni don't know if this would convince you, but as i kid, before i begged and pleaded and gave up allowances for 2 months to prove i wanted to go. and i regretted it deeply after.\n\ni don't care anymore. but jeeez, what a goddam waste. \n\n\ntl:dr - waste of money, a camp with a few carnival rides that was less educational than any given math, science or skill specific camp. difference is the branding and the cost. there is no increase in value, only on cost. if this was a \"i should have gone to camp. maybe, but i should have gone to space camp. it has the same logo as my nasa camp did, i suspect it was the same thing.   no added value.",

    "body": "I know you said Mobile, AL but do you mean the US Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, AL? I went there in middle school. I thought it was fun. I went on a school trip. I'm not sure I can call it a field trip because I'm from Indiana and we went over the weekend. The group of students who went were people who wanted to go so it wasn't for a class. On the trip we buddied up with someone else and that person ended up being a good friend of mine throughout high school and I still keep in touch with him (I am one year out of college). \n\nHaving said all of that can you say that your trip would have ended up the same way or better? My enjoyment was due to the school trip and buddy system that was complete luck in it's pairing of myself and my friend. I also only remember two things about the entire weekend trip, which probably totals 20 minutes. My area of study and my career do not reflect an early interest in space or rocketry. Considering all of this, it is a nice memory but I cannot say my life is enriched by the experience. I have an interest in space now but that comes from other areas such as Neil Tyson, sci fi movies, and recent scientific events.\n\nI'm not saying it sucked back then like you want me to say but apparently it wasn't that great because I don't remember all that much about it. If your interest in science is making you reflect and wish that you went (you don't really give a reason), there are ways to get similar effects. Go to the National Air and Space museum in D.C. and watch an educational film in iMAX and there's most of Space Camp right there.",

You only got to do a tiny bit of what you hoped and only a few kids got to do the fun stuff (and only for a few minutes).  Spending a day walking through the museum was the best part by a large margin.  I still enjoy that when I pass through Huntsville.\n\nTo put this into perspective, I entered a trivia contest at DragonCon in the late 90s.  I tied for 2nd with two others.  The top 3 got to have a play off with the top prize being a trip to adult Space Camp.  The 4th place prize was a $50 gift certificate to a local used bookstore.  I volunteered to take 4th because I preferred the gift certificate to the trip (and the second and third prizes).",

An officer can't be expected to stay 50 feet away from absolutely everyone he confronts.\n\nActually though I see something here that might change my view.  What do you think the proper protocol was?  How should Wilson have handled the situation?  As far as I could see, Wilson was taking the most reasonable options available to him, or at least there's reason to believe he may well have been.

They part after that fight and she goes on to become among the most powerful characters in the series, completely independent of the \"lone weirdo\". \n\nNot saying SAO is flawless, but I think you may have prejudged it a tad.",

    "body": "The patent system as a whole is good (including software patents). The only problems with the patent office today is that it grants patents that are later found to be invalid, and that some patents last too long. CMV\n\nThis post will focus on software patents since that is what I am most familiar with.\n\nI think that the patent system should serve two purposes: rewarding effort, and providing incentives for innovation, and that it currently does that. Some of the problems people often bring up in the current system are:\n\nPatents are granted for things that are too easy to create: I think that the expiration date for a patent should be set by the examiner and should be dependent on the investment that went into developing the technology. Drug patents that require billions of dollars of research can continue to have long terms. Software patents that require half a year of research by a few people will have shorter terms. This is not a major overhaul of the system, and supports the goal of providing incentives for innovation by forcing companies to continue to innovate if they want to have exclusive access to technology (and all the financial benefits that gives).\n\nPatents are granted for things that have already been invented: These patents should not be granted. This is not a change to the current system.\n\nPatent trolls are a thing: If the patents being used to 'troll' are legitimate, I think this is not a problem, due to the goal of rewarding effort. I think that a person who is a skilled inventor but unskilled at manufacturing, distribution, marketing, or all the other things necessary to make money from an invention should still be rewarded for his invention, by selling the right to use his invention to other companies. Or, he should be able to outsource the selling part to people who are good at that, while he continues doing what he is good at, which is inventing.\n\nPatents are granted on math: Allowing patents on math helps provide both stated goals of the patents system. If someone discovers or create a new algorithm or formula, they should be rewarded for it, even though it is \"Just\" math.\n\nTo the people who think that all patents should be abolished, or that all patents within a certain industry should be abolished: I think that would result in a return to the days of trade secrets, which I would consider to be a very bad thing, and result in more incentives to protect your secrets than incentives to innovate.\n\nTo change my view you must either show that your proposed change to the patent system will further the goals I’ve provided for the patent system, or you must change my view on what the goals of the patent system should be.",

    "body": "I think There Will Be Blood is a terrible movie. CMV (Spoilers, obviously)\n\nHonestly, where to even begin describing why I don't like this movie.\n\n* Characters:  Daniel Plaineview makes no fucking sense.  He seems pretty reasonable in the beginning of the film.  Sure he's a bit of a dick to Eli, but honestly, Eli is a cunt.  For some reason, Daniel just snaps and goes Heisenberg the second H.W. loses his hearing.  Daniel's character is pretty much pointless after H.W. loses his hearing.  Now onto Eli.  Eli is a little whiny bitch.  Seriously, how does he have a following?  He has the worst public speaking voice ever, honestly, he sounds like a 4 year old having a temper tantrum.  I could see him having an actual following if he had a deeper voice, or had a more Hitler style of giving sermons.  Eli doesn't really serve any purpose after Daniel bought the land.  H.W.  H.W. is pretty much just Daniel's cute face, which at least Daniel admits, but he's really not relevant to the plot in the least and doesn't even need to exist.  Henry.  What the fuck was the point of that?  If there's any characters who I missed, well, they weren't memorable then.\n\n* Plot/Narrative:  There doesn't seem to be one.  What the fuck was that ending?\n\n* Storytelling:  I don't think the people who made this movie know what story telling actually is, the entire film just seems disjointed and makes no sense.  \n\n* Music:  The music didn't really add to the movie in most cases, it just was kind of in the way.\n\nSo, there's my reasons for not liking the movie.  So many people give it such high praise, and I don't even understand why.  I checked the Wikipedia article for it and the worst reviews it got basically said \"meh.\"  I'm not even meh about this movie, I downright don't like it.",
