Your Boo-Bear, for whatever reason, thinks that he wants a sphynx cat.  While your statement above is unclear, I am going to assume that he has experience with cats as well.  Now I would recommend that you ask him why he wants this particular type, and what he thinks of the cuddly issue.  But, remember that there is always the added benefit of, as long as you talk about it and do it together, making your Boo-Bear happy.  I'm not saying go along with it just because he wants to, but try to understand why he wants to, and realize that this is a decision you are making together, which really adds to the relationship.\n\n2)  Holy shit that cat is sa-weeeeet!  First off, its distinct!  Your friends will be like \"woah! that's the coolest cat ever! So unique!\"  It stands up proud like its not gonna take shit from nobody!  Also, its basically a God!  The Egyptians worshipped em, its even named for a mythical creature of incredible intelligence.  Hell, the Egyptians were so terrified of those things that during the Battle of Pelusium, the Persian Cambyses II released hundreds of 'em and the Egyptian refused to fight, lest they harm their Cat-God.  Persians killed em where they stood! That cat helped conquer nations, can a tabby say that?\n\n2) Now its disputed but they may be better for people with allergies.  See they don't have fur, and people are allergic to chemicals in cat dander, which is spread all over by the fur, when they're petter or whatever.  But this ain't got none of those little allergy missiles!  So while the allergy problem isn't TOTALLY gone, it is reduced.  Now you can make friends with the lesser-folk!\n\n3)  ANYTHING can be cuddly!  My friend has porcupine he carries everywhere!  His roommate sleeps with his snake wrapped all around him!  He even just got a badass tarantula that sits on his shoulder!  See, you just need to appreciate your pet, and to accept it for what it has to offer!  Look here: http://imgur.com/a/Qsrl3\nSee, \"cuddly\" is a frame of mind!\n\nDisclaimer:  I am by no means an expert on cats or any other living organism for that matter.  Please consult the breeder, veterinarians, etc., for the REAL advice.\n\nI hope this helps!",

I googled it and aparently while not all Spynx have peach fuzz it is not uncommon. If you want a Spynx with a tiny bit of hair I am sure you can find one.

I googled \"sphynx cat rescue\" and actually came up with a few links. Also, one of the cats I talked about before? He was the \"rrunt\" of his family, aparetnly the breeder thought he could not sell him and actually gave him for free to his new owner. So it's harder to rescue a purebreed cat, but possible.",

One example I just remembered is the Ministry being a much more real presence, which brought a maturity to a world that was mostly run by a just-kids mentality for two books. However, even though the distractions from Voldemort were much-needed and never boring, it feels like PoA was artificially set up as such. The later books (i.e. the much longer ones) had what I feel is a better balance of non-Voldy plot development and main storyline events. But in PoA, it feels like Rowling decided to dedicate an entire book to just fleshing out the world. It was obviously successful, but I think it stands out as something like a very interesting intermission for the series instead of a legitimate entry in the saga of Harry Potter, the Boy who Lived.",

Off the top of my head from the first 3 seasons you have Paintball, the Bottle ep, the Xmas claymation, Halloween zombies, Paintball II, D&amp;D, the video game ep, and the alternate universe ep. Nothing from S4 comes to mind.\n\nOf course comedy is subjective but I don't think S4 has a single ep worthy of a top 10 and would be lucky to have one or two in the top 20. At the same time if we did a bottom 10 it wouldn't be all S4 or even half S4 so it isn't as bad as some make it. The difference is real however that S4 had no single brilliant 10/10 or even 9/10 episodes.",

    "body": "Since the original text is deleted, here's the text form the original post:\n\nThrowaway account. \n\nFirst of all, I am a 24 year old male, engaged to my girlfriend (now fiance) of 6 years. We are in a great place and are getting married in October. \n\nLast night I went to my best friend's birthday party. My fiance is out of town til Tuesday. I arrived around 1030pm after pre-gaming with two other friends, so when I arrived I was pretty sloshed. I remember arriving. \n\nI also remember running into a girl, we'll call Mandy, I had known in high school. We had dated briefly and she was my first blowjob back then. Anyway. We caught up and all that, and I remember her being particularly flirty. I told her I was engaged and even showed her pictures of my fiance. Then, I went about my night. I remember my best friend pulling me aside and told me that Mandy was wanting to hook up with me, and was overly flirty. I was honestly pretty oblivious of her advances. \n\nAnyway, I kept drinking. Took several shots of Southern Comfort, and eventually blacked out. The only thing I remember after that is a quick flash of me vomiting out in the back yard. But something else happened. \n\nMy best friend said he walked upstairs to grab a towel, because someone had thrown up in his kitchen. When he opened the door, apparently Mandy was giving me a blowjob. I was apparently just lying there, looked like I was asleep. In his drunken state, he didn't think much of it, so he shut the door. \n\nI woke up the next morning around 7am, alone. My pants were completely off, and I still had my shirt on. I found out later from my best friend he overheard Mandy on her way out telling someone we had sex. I was completely blacked out, probably even passed out. I was definitely raped.\n\nI don't know what to tell my fiance. I'm trying to keep it under wraps. I'm afraid she won't believe I was raped. What do I do?\n\n**TL;DR** I was raped by an old flame at my friend's party. I have a fiance and I'm afraid of telling her in fear she won't believe me.\n\nEdit 1: Just called my fiance, told her I had something I wanted to talk to her about and not to worry. I just didn't want to pretend everything was normal til Tuesday. She is coming home early and will be back tomorrow evening. I've worried her, and now I'm even more afraid to tell her...\n\nEdit 2: Thank you everyone for your support. I'm still incredibly worried about telling my fiance. But it's gotta happen. I will post an update tomorrow night if I can. Honestly, I'm more worried about losing my love than I am hurt that it happened. I don't think I will need counseling, I'm a pretty level headed and rational person. NOT that people who do need counseling aren't! Just for me, personally, I don't think it would help much. Just a personal preference. Everybody copes differently. \n\nEdit 3: I just talk to my best friend. We both agree, it definitely appears I was raped. He says the more he think about it, the more he thought I was asleep or passed out when she was blowing me. He apologized for not stopping it, but was so drunk he just didn't think anything of it. He's willing to talk to my fiance is she needs proof. Also he is going to try and talk to Mandy soon. He's just thinking of a way to do it tactfully. I will also update with how that goes.\n\n[Source](http://np.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/2423ao/i_was_raped_last_night_im_engaged_im_a_man/)",

It was the injury that should be blamed much as if another person pushed her down the stairs would be blamed.\n\nNow, instead of an old person its a person with depression. They're at the top of the stairs looking down and their mind breaks too much at that moment and they toss themselves forward. The injuries from the fall leads to his death. Do you blame the person, the fall or the mental injury?\n\nIt's the above reasons that insurance companies pay out for suicide so long as the policy is two years or older. We assume that taking out a policy just prior to suicide makes the act a conscious thought with hopes that the death leads to a cash reward to others. However, suicide as a result of mental illness is not considered a rational choice and death from that is considered as much an accident as falling down the stairs due to a physical injury. \n\nConsidering the above, you could say that killing one's self due to depression is not suicide but death due to illness. As such, given the evidence with Kurt Cobain, he did not commit suicide.\n\nEnabling:\n\nIf a person is depressed and taking illicit drugs and alcohol that exacerbates the problem, it can be deadly. Now, what about the people that know about that person's issues and callously ignores them and even offers to provide substances or enables the destructive behavior? I would argue that falls under reckless endangerment, and given the mental illness factor could be criminal in nature. \n\nWhile Courtney loved Kurt (actually, I don't know, but let's just assume so), her lifestyle continued to pull Kurt further and further down till his mind snapped to the point that he killed himself. She was the one that provided the push, and if she was not mentally ill herself can be responsible for the death of Kurt.\n\nConspiracy:\n\nNot touching that path.",

    "body": "Admittedly the facism thing was just bullshit. But here are some points we can move along on. \n\n1)Cops are trained to subdue people. This is true, but they are also trained to be physically fit, courteous/professional, and competent in the law. However, most cops rarely get more than 6 months of training. Taking into account that 6 months of doing anything puts the average person at a skill level of just above novice, we have to know what their abilities are. Cops will not be able to stop an assailant without causing serious injury or death. Just like anyone else, they are entitled to kill if an assailant presents them with the intent to harm/kill them. Police do not magically have the ability to subdue criminals.\n\n2)Killing someone is rarely the best option. But we hardly choose our circumstances, especially when our assailants force those circumstances on us. We have to recognize that police officers being attacked can not change circumstances simply because they have been trained. They are just like any other average person. And so they should be given the right to defend themselves just like any other average person.\n\n3)If cops should/ought to be the type of people to be able to prevail over these kinds of circumstances then we need to either extend the rights of the average citizen as to make the service of police obsolete or we need to extensively reconstruct the way we train police officers. I think that in order to satisfy your standard of what an officer should be able to do, we need to train them to be on par with special military forces. The problem with that is that we give the government a paramilitary force in small towns. \nImagine if you will: Police are trained to a standard such that they can physically subdue someone 100lbs heavier than them. Do we really want every police officer in our town to have that much power? Do we want government giving orders to such people? Police forces are already corrupt but now they have the physical power to act with impunity. I guess this is where my facism thing ties in.\n\nIn short, we either need to give more rights to citizens so that police are obsolete and we can avoid police brutality or we must train police to be on par with the military and risk giving government and police too much power.",

He probably got out of the car and started shooting from where he was. I doubt he can shoot and run at the same time. If he was running after Brown he would have to holster his gun or run with his gun drawn, both of which would make him run more slowly than Brown who had a head start and probably in fear for his life.\n\nI believe the testimony that Wilson was shooting at Brown while he was running away, because it's the most reasonable explanation for why Brown turned around and put his hands up.\n\nSo from what I can piece together, Wilson was probably 30-40 yards away from Brown and Brown with his hands up, walking a few paces forward.

People that had a responsibility to report the incident (including Paterno) arguably did not do enough to 1) ensure that these incidents were properly investigated and 2) ensure that Sandusky did not continue to have unfettered access to victims.\n\nHowever, let's talk about the things that are questionable. People that arguably had the same (or a greater) requirement to report the incident in question were contacted by McQuery both before and after he met with Paterno. \n\nNow, let's talk about some things that weren't largely addressed in the media. Sandusky was not acting as a University official at the time of the incidents - he was acting as an official for the Second Mile, a charity organization that he himself founded. He used his access to the University to further the goals of this organization, but he was not a University employee - Paterno was not his boss and neither was Tim Curley. Despite this, both Paterno and Curley contacted superiors in regards to the incident (Paterno met with Curley the day after McQuery met with him; Curley met with Univeristy President Graham Spanier the day after that). \n\nCurley banned Sandusky from University facilities and also contacted the CEO of the Second Mile - the man who **was** Sandusky's boss, and comprised him of the incident. His response? He told Sandusky to wear shorts in the shower.\n\nNow, let's talk about the fact that *multiple people did not report the incident to law enforcement, despite a requirement to do so*. Within the entire chain, there are at least a dozen individuals who were apprised of a potentially criminal incident that should have contacted authorities, and yet they didn't. \n\nAt least three of Paterno's supervisors, Sandusky's boss at the Second Mile, and two board members from that organization had been informed about the incident.\n\nBut that's not all - a totally separate incident that went through an entirely separate chain of supervision (OPP - the division of the University responsible for maintenance) *had the same result.*\n\nDoesn't this point to a more systematic problem? One that perhaps goes beyond a single football coach? Isn't it possible that Paterno did what he thought was his responsibility, just like a dozen other people that were made aware of the incident?",

    "body": "read interviews from Gilligan and co post Breaking Bad. They pretty much agree with you. However, it's the most realistic \"nice ending\" he could get. Sure his life sucks but 1. he's free that means he's no longer a meth slave!!! and 2. he showed real agency rejecting Walter White's demands for perhaps the first time. \nthat's not what i took away from that speech. \"i did it for me\" is admitting he did it for himself, for the power, money, status, etc. He's confessing his sins and achieving a brief true reconcilliation. \nto be fair remember why Walter goes back. He doesn't go back to save Jessie, he goes back because he sees baby blue and thinks Jessie is working with the nazis. He has a change of heart only after he sees Jessie. Before he's going out in a blaze of glory motivated by his supervillian thoughts. \n\nAnyways Ozymandius king of kings look upon my works ye mighty and despair   was the \"real\" ending of Walter White supervillian. The last episodes see Walter as a broken man who sort of turned a corner. \n\n\nthat being said: it's clear God-showrunner granted him a \"perfect\" final couple of days and it's not clear how it makes sense that for instnace he gets into skylar's house without being detected. he gets more redemption than he deserves but the way i make sense of it is to think of it as the epilogue with ozymandius being the finale and it functions the same way the end and epilogue of say \"crime and punishment\" does.",

He didn't have much if anything to do with earning back his physical freedom. In any event I don't think the scene was written / shot in a way that acknowledges the serious lack of closure for Jesse, but just tries to leave us on a 'high note'. \nRevenge that was not hollow, as it should have been, but targeted at characters who were clearly and unquestionably antagonistic. Walter's final revenge was deliberately constructed so that we'd be completely on his side for the first time since many seasons prior. That was a cop-out on the part of the writers.",

    "body": "Lame compared to what?  What is a finale that you found highly satisfying?\n\nThere are a couple reasons why these never live up to expectations.\n\n1) Once a show gets big, showrunners and the network are in a tug of war over how long it should continue.  Showrunners tend to want to end the show more quickly and efficiently, whereas the network wants to drag things out (because more episodes creates more money).  Breaking Bad is a good example of this.  You have the main antagonist (Gus) killed off in season 4, but there is still more airtime to fill, so the show has to build up a whole new (less intense and shorter) story with the White Power guys.  No finale in which Walt confronts the White Power guys could have been as powerful as the end of Gus.\n\nRelated to this is the Chekov's gun problem.  If you hang a gun on the wall in Act 1, someone has to fire it by Act 3.  As shows get dragged on in unnatural ways, especially shows with commercial breaks, you need to write in lots of cliffhangers, which often involve introducing new dimensions to the story (see: Lost).  This can easily get away for you and you end up leaving a bunch of loose threads or create continuity errors (see: Lost).  Breaking Bad ties up pretty much every plot and prop point though (i.e., the ricin).   \n\n2) Classically, narratives have a certain structure: rising action, climax, falling action, denouement (reflection).  In serial TV, the big problem is that everyone wants the finale to be a huge, blockbuster episode.  But, it isn't supposed to be.  You are supposed to have the huge climax sometime before the last hour of a 40+ hour story.  Really, the last episode should be pretty calm and character-driven (think everything in Lord of The Rings after they drop the ring in the mountain).    \n\nBreaking Bad actually dealt with falling action and denouement better than most shows.  You have the showdown in Ozymandias with Hank and, then a few episodes of Walt reflecting in New Hampshire.  But because the finale needs to have some sort of major climactic event, the show needed to build in the whole White Power showdown.  Basically, it is a very tough needle to thread, and Breaking Bad probably did it better than most.  Sopranos didn't even try.",

    "body": "First off, let me state it's been a while since my last viewing, so forgive me if I mistake details.  That said-\nThis is true, which is why real world politicians tend to not make grand promises of what they will accomplish, but rather what they will fight for- with no guarantee of delivery.  Her campaign was run purely on hopes and dreams, and more than a few politicians have seen the end of their careers when they failed to deliver those.  Failure of this magnitude is a justifiable reason to seek a change in president, regardless of how realistic the goal is.\nThis is an illogical response, one born of emotion rather than reason.  Understandable, but not justifiable.  They are offering badly needed aid, that you arguably may not survive without.  It could be suicide to dismiss them, meeting them with violence could be costly, and trusting them explicitly would be unwise.  Therefore the rational solution is to accept their aid, but monitor them closely and limit their movement until you can be sure of their trustworthiness.  I believe that Adama satisfied these conditions in the initial standoff when they arrived.  Their interaction with the fleet was limited, and Galactica positioned itself with a lethal response ready at all times until their trust was earned by way of the testimony of trusted allies and deeds done by the Cylons.  Even then Adama was reluctant, but was pressed by circumstance to accept them.  Mind you, this is how they handled Athena when she returned with Helo.\nVery true.  At that point, their government bore little resemblance to a democracy and looked much more like a dictatorship, though I would argue this was necessary given the fragility of the fleet and responsibilities of its admiral.  Despite it's deeply negative stigma and undemocratic nature, martial law is not without its merits when used responsibly.\n\nNow here comes the part where I disagree with you- mutiny was not the answer.  I will admit that mutiny is a justifiable means in certain scenarios, but this was not one of them. \n\n* Firstly, Adama's actions were (mostly) neither unreasonable nor without their own justifications, which as I recall was communicated to the fleet.  His unofficial reign after Roslin's unofficial abdication was also very short before the mutiny, which was orchestrated by people with a long-standing grudge (Zarek and Gaeta).\n\n* Secondly, the primary spark was the presence of the Cylons who made every effort to be valuable to the fleet and nonthreatening.  As I said above, violent opposition to their presence was irrational.\n\n* Third, Adama and his loyalty had been proven multiple times at this point, having saved the fleet more times than anyone can count, and his judgement has proven sound throughout their years on the run.  The sudden change of opinion in the fleet was ignorant of this.  While it's not really reasonable to say he should never be doubted, it should have given far more pause than the colonists gave.\n\n* Finally, mutiny was a potentially self-destructive action.  Given the precarious position the fleet was in, a mutiny could have resulted in unnecessary loss of life (it did), loss of critical ships/resources/infrastructure, permanent damage to the survivability of the fleet and, by extension, the human race.\n\n**TL;DR**, Given the risks, Adama's track record, and irrational motivations, I find that while mutiny was not without cause, it was unjustified as a solution, especially above other options.\n\n-edit- words, etc.",

Not much of what he has mentioned has been explained in the actual series. I can't like Kirito because he never struggles to progress, he always screams his way out of everything and has never lost a fight. He breaks out of paralysis and saves Asuna, how did that happen? He destroys a boss monster because he's pissed off that his guild was wiped? I thought this was a group game? None of this can be explained because the writer made that fatal mistake. Top 50 anime don't make these core mistakes.\n\n\nSticking together is the best bet for every character in a group-based MMO but apparently Kirito is above that. Another question is how is Asuna's stats roughly lower or the same as Kirito's when she has been with an actual guild doing far more dungeons than what Kirito seemed to be doing?",
