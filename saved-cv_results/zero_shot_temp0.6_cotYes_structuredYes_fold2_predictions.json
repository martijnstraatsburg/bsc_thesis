I think John does look fairly unusual for an Englishman as he does have a quite flat nose and narrow eyes. \n\nWhile it looks like some of the pictures in your links may be from his retirement period (most notably the one where he is naked and cradling up to Yoko), a majority of them are between 1968 and I'd say around '74 as that is when the pair of them were most active, both in music and activism. Mind you, John did re-enter the music business shortly before his death in 1980 so there are a few shots in there that can throw you off. You can usually tell though because they have both aged significantly, as can be seen in [this shot](http://i.imgur.com/P6ltXc8.jpg).\n\nCheers for my first delta, glad I could help shed some light on it.",

    "body": "Depression as a mood and depression as a mood disorder are two different things. Many people experience periods of transient depression. This is not a disorder, but it still can be quite severe and result in self-harm or suicide. Depression as a mood disorder is persistent, and in many cases lifelong, feelings of being \"down\", inadequate, worthless, suicidal, and just generally dissatisfied with life. \nThese may be people who are experiencing transient periods of depression, these may be liars, or they may be people covering up their depression. Speaking for myself as someone who has an anxiety disorder that causes persistent depression, I was known to be quite a boisterous, friendly and upbeat person in college. Many times I was the life of a party and I had a very large group of friends among whom I was known for being excitable and happy. Then I would go to my dorm room and cry or cut myself. Neither of those things was fake either. My friends genuinely made me happy, and why would I want to bring out my depression into a situation in which I was happy? Why would I want to deliberately bring myself and others down? On top of this, I would occasionally experience manic episodes. Mania is the other pole from which bipolar disorder gets its name. Whereas depression is characterized by a lack of energy and feelings of apathy or hopelessness, mania is characterized by an overwhelming intensity of energy that can result in anxiousness and panic, often resulting in that hair-trigger anger that people imagine when they think of BPD, or if you're lucky and spending time with people you like that mania can result in a high-energy euphoria that is actually one of the best feelings I have ever experienced. One of the things that bummed me out the most when I went on medication was knowing that these euphoric episodes would go away.\n\nAnyways, hope that helped some.",

Dr. Vogel's character, while brilliantly played by Charlotte Rampling, made no fucking sense.  Her connection to Dexter and Harry is ludicrous.  At no point in the series was she even hinted at.  To me, it was clear that the writers never envisioned this aspect of Dexter's myth when they created the show and the character, it was purely forced into place for this one season.  \n  \nThe other new characters also seemed to only be introduced to be killed so that the characters we've all come to know get to live (save Deb, who dies because of a one in a million blood clot- just so she and Dex can have one last conversation while she's in the hospital).  No other arc is closed.  Angel, Quinn, and Matthews are still in the dark about who Dexter really was.  This makes LaGuerta's death even more pointless than it already seemed.  Jamie still hasn't done anything important.  \n  \nThose things plus Dexter and Hannah turning into bumbling idiots as already pointed out turned the last season into a disaster.  The other HUGE GAPPING hole that was never addressed in either S7 or S8 was the scene in S5 where Deb walks in on Dexter and Lumen about to kill Jordan Chase (they can't see each other because of a opaque tarp) and Deb lets them go.  Suddenly Deb finds out Dexter is a serial killer and has this huge crisis of conscious.  In what universe does it make sense that the scene in the basement never comes up between the two of them???????????????",

However I do think that not having to cut weight is something of an advantage at heavyweight.  Whether or not it's more of an advantage than size itself is debatable, but clearly most heavyweights don't bulk up to 265, and there are very few human beings that would have to cut down to 265 (unless they're fat obviously).  There seems to be diminishing returns on size once you get well over 200 lbs.  Ali wasn't that big himself, though he had a huge reach, much like Jon Jones, who many would have considered a favorite at heavyweight, even against the likes of Cain Velasquez.  It's extremely rare for fighters in other divisions to weigh in at less than a pound or two under the limit.  If UFC had a super heavyweight division I probably wouldn't give Lesnar as much credit.\n\nCain also has more losses in title fights, and what he may or may not do in the future is irrelevant.  Couture has more wins in title fights than Cain, especially if you consider his lhc reigns.  Would you consider Couture above Cain?",

The franchise's response *would* try to address everything with an excuse, whether anyone were guilty or not, but most of it seems perfectly reasonable. The main thing I have a problem with was this:\nWhile it could be just a coincidence that looks really bad, I'm not buying that he was told he'd have to do his job and in response requested bribes of cash and shoes as a joke.\n\nThanks for the link to the team's response, I'll have to read that.",

Here are links: \n\nVideos suggesting the shooting was a hoax:\n-http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFo3x_UgQ80\n- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mlszDIRZb0\n\nIt appears that this type of this has happened before, with 911, the England bus bombing, etc. Internet research. \n\nSo to conclude, I really want to see what you guys think.
