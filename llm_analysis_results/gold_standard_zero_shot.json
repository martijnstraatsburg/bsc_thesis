The taxing journey would have also severely weakened people's ability to destroy it.

    "body": "Here are my biggest issues with Alien 3. First, I agree with you that the cast, music, and ending are awesome. The tension of a female prisoner on a world of celibate men is also great.\n\nHowever, the following things are really annoying:\n\n- In the first movie, there was one alien. In Aliens, there were a ton of aliens, making the adversary even more terrifying. However, in the third movie, they are back to one alien. So, how do they up the terror factor in a world with one alien? See next point.\n\n- No weapons. The only way to create tension with only one alien is to have a world with no weapons. Are you kidding me? Now, Alien and Aliens are still great horror/sci-fi movies without the action, but the whole \"don't shoot them, they bleed acid\" and \"you need a flamethrower\" themes have completely been thrown out. They are completely defenseless, and the lack of any firearm action really takes away from the movie.\n\n- The fact that the alien they are fighting used a dog as a host. Thus, it takes on traits of the dog, looks like a dog, etc. Apparently, this is why the aliens in the first two movies look like they do; they used humans as hosts. Apparently, this is a mythology point with the alien franchise. BUT IT IS NEVER EXPLAINED. The alien also looks very different from what we expect, but they never explain why.\n\n- The fucking 1st person camera angles. Oh my God. Because they can't have multiple alien kills or any kind of firearm violence, they attempt to up the scares with first person shots of the alien chasing people.
