The *general* phenomenon that describes the tendency for people to be attracted to similar-looking people doesn't have a specific term, it's just one factor among many that determines attraction. An informal naming of it would be \"like-attracts-like\", as Wikipedia describes it.\n\nA more specific idea within this idea does have a term: [Matching Hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_hypothesis), which focuses on one's attraction to someone who is just as socially desirable as one's self.",

If you want to mess up someone's car, it's unlikely you'll ever be caught. Just do it and stop trying to morally justify it.\n\ntl;dr: Don't always assume someone is just being a malicious dick, and don't retaliate.",

    "body": "Zunes were never cool. CMV.\n\nLet's face it: Zune (the media delivery service, the actual device) was just a blatant attempt by Microsoft to compete and stay relevant when faced with an ascendant Apple. I'm by no means an Apple fanboy, but nothing is less cool than copying wholesale what is currently popular. The mp3 players looked bad, the sites were godawful, and Zune is generally considered to be emblematic of the tack the Microsoft has taken to compete with Apple, which hasn't been great. \"Leasing\" songs to your Zune-having friends was two steps forward idea-wise, but 3 steps back CRM-wise. Watching the build up and \"hype\" to the release of Zune was like watching a car crash in slow motion.\n\nI'm not saying that Zune was useless or uninteresting or ineffective, my view is simply that it isn't, and never was, cool. Hip. Desirable to have. You will have changed my view when you make me (or some past version of me) desire a Zune.",
