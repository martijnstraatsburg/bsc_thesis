There are lots of people that come across good opportunities, but many of them are either unprepared for them or do not pounce on them when they appear so the luck is squandered.\n\nThe extremely successful position themselves to take advantage of every lucky break that comes along.\n\nSo this isn't exactly a refutation of exactly what you said. But perhaps it might change how you view luck in a more general way. A lot of times the more successful didn't have more luck than others, but they were able to better take advantage of the luck they had.",

From the perspective of the characters, Arvo is a known liar, clearly hostile, has tried to escape, and has tried to have your group killed. It just doesn't make sense that so many of the characters go out of their way to help him. \n\nNevertheless, despite all the actions Arvo has taken against the group, they still try to help him. Arvo responds by shooting Clem. Now I think it's important to note that depending on your choices, at the time Clem was shot she would have been completely innocent.\n\nTaking my play through as an example:\n\n* Clem didn't steal from him\n* Clem didn't attack him\n* Clem had put her gun down when she was shot.\n\nArvo shot a little unarmed girl just because he was sad? Doesn't cut it for me.\nFirst off, I don't think we can overlook the fact that Lee was talking to an 8 year old. It seemed very obvious to me that he was sugar coating it a bit.\n\nRegardless, that isn't an excuse, and there are plenty of examples out there that show Arvo was a relatively bad person. \n\nChrista had more of a reason to blame Clem for Omid's death than Arvo had a reason to blame Clem for anything. She didn't take it out on her, or shoot her, she attempted to move and even took care of Clem.\nIt is implied that Lee's crime involved people really close to him, which led to a sense of betrayal and overreaction. It's definitely bad, but not the same as Arvo.\n\nWhat I think you are forgetting is that Arvo was a terrible person BEFORE all the bad stuff happened to him, and that he took out his anger on an innocent bystander.\n\nThe entire catalyst to his shitty situation was him putting Clem's group in mortal danger based on a lie.\n\nI'd even go one step further and say Kenny was right. It seemed really obvious that Arvo was going to try and kill someone. Had the group just been reasonable and listened to Kenny to begin with, then all the deaths in E5 could have been avoided.",

It wasn't really just that I disliked him as a person, I disliked him as a *character.* He didn't seem smartly written to me, he just seemed like an annoying character. He wasn't believably annoying, he wasn't interestingly annoying, he was just annoying. He wasn't a \"flawed character\" because he barely even qualified as a character to me. Characters, to me, either need to have some sort of redeeming quality to them or otherwise serve some sort of purpose to the plot. The book hardly had a plot and was basically just some annoying guy wandering around the city doing random shit and saying stupid as hell things. It was just bad.\nWell then that's the other thing. He asked where the ducks went to basically *friggen everyone.* You're telling me not a single goddamn person he ran into knew or could be bothered to utter the word \"migration?\"",

They cross paths, a misunderstanding occurs, and one ends up dead during a fight. Personally, I think Zimmerman would have done the same (ie following someone) for ANY person who looked suspicious. I also don't think the outcome of the case was racist either, since it was done in self defense, especially considering the injuries Zimmerman sustained. When all was said and done... yeah it's sad a teenager died, but I don't think there were any racial overtones at all. \n\nCMV, please.",
