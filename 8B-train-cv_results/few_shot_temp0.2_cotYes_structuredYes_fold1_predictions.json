    "body": "You probably have a point in that they look quite similar, at least as much as a white Englishman and a small Japanese lady can look alike, but I think you've misunderstood the nature of their relationship. She came in to his life at a time when he was experimenting heavily with LSD, a drug which he has stated killed his ego completely. He was extremely dissatisfied with his involvement with the Beatles and the fame that it had brought him. When he first met Yoko, she didn't give a shit who he was. Can you imagine the allure of a woman who couldn't care less about your fame after years of being chased by screaming girls every time you set foot in public?\n\nI think you'll find also that they were extremely aligned in their philosophical and political beliefs, which was the bedrock of their relationship really. Also, from 1975-1980 he virtually withdrew completely from the public eye to be with his family. People with trophy wives (which is essentially what you are equating Yoko to) simply don't do that.",

    "body": "I somewhat agree but I'm going to take a shot anyways. Perhaps I can get you to share in my ambivalence.\n\nFirst some background stuff: There are a lot of misconceptions surrounding tort law (the law of civil liability) and I want to clear up some of the more common ones. (This would be a fruitless endeavor if we weren't starting on the same page.) Am I safe in assuming that:\n\n1. You are not a lawyer, and\n2. Your idea of what liability of law is comes from the waivers we have to sign when we go Scuba diving, parachuting, and mountain climbing?\n\nMany of the provisions under those disclaimers are for CYA purposes only. Chances are, if someone tried to sue for most of the things covered under such a waiver they wouldn't win anyways, the cost of adding in such a provision is so cheap (the cost of a few extra peices of paper and ink) that companies feel its worthwhile to do so, in case they get an irrational jury or something. \n\nThe effect of this is that the boundaries of what might actually create liability are actually far, far narrower than what you might think just from reading the waivers. \n\n\nThat being said: I would challenge the idea that possibility of civil remedy promotes poor decision-making on two ground.\n\n********\n\nFirst -- I would challenge the idea that possibility of civil remedy promotes poor decision-making with the fact that in all jurisdictions I know of, the defendant in a lawsuit for negligence has the defense of **comparative negligence**. \n\nThat is to say, if the defendant can show that the plaintiff was negligent and that contributed to his injury, the defendant may be relieved of some or all of his liability, depending on the degree of the plaintiff's negligence compared to that of the defendant.\n\nMany states have the rule where if the plaintiff was even one iota negligent, the defendant is completely relieved of ANY liability regardless of how negligent he was. This is called **contributory negligence** and it's a little more controversial. (For the reasons you mention, I am ambivalent as to which is the better rule.)\n\nPart two incoming (because apparently people are getting impatient).",

Pills are among the cleanest suicide methods. \n\n3 - knowledge\n\nOverdosing on pills is HARD to do well. You don't need a controlled substance - lots of over the counter meds will do it. \n\nYou had this friend in high school who tried it previously, that means he was probably 16 at most when it happened.

There was some ambiguity in his character that keeps you intrigued. There is obviously something to his relationship with H.W. that goes beyond simple exploitation. Saving him from the oil well and the way he cradle him afterwards shows that there is some sort feelings there. Also how he greets H.W. on his return from the school again shows that something has developed between them. Also his interactions with Henry show that he wanted some sort of human relationship otherwise he would of just sent him away after their first meeting.\n\nI didn't have any problem with the structure of the movie or the leaps in time. This is the first I've heard of anybody having issue with that as well. I don't know what else to say about that.\n\nI don't think broader context was really necessary for the film and in fact think that the intense focus on Plainview was one of its strengths. I think broadening the focus would have meant that the film would have lost its tension.\n\nI don't see Plainview killing Eli as puzzling. In fact I think it is really the only ending that would have made sense. What happens to somebody that is driven by success to sociopathic ends after they win that success? They turn on themselves and anybody around them. This is why it also showed Plainview pushing H.W. out of his life for good.",

The tension of a female prisoner on a world of celibate men is also great.\n\nHowever, the following things are really annoying:\n\n- In the first movie, there was one alien. In Aliens, there were a ton of aliens, making the adversary even more terrifying. However, in the third movie, they are back to one alien. So, how do they up the terror factor in a world with one alien? See next point.\n\n- No weapons. The only way to create tension with only one alien is to have a world with no weapons. Are you kidding me? Now, Alien and Aliens are still great horror/sci-fi movies without the action, but the whole \"don't shoot them, they bleed acid\" and \"you need a flamethrower\" themes have completely been thrown out. They are completely defenseless, and the lack of any firearm action really takes away from the movie.\n\n- The fact that the alien they are fighting used a dog as a host. Thus, it takes on traits of the dog, looks like a dog, etc. Apparently, this is why the aliens in the first two movies look like they do; they used humans as hosts. Apparently, this is a mythology point with the alien franchise. BUT IT IS NEVER EXPLAINED. The alien also looks very different from what we expect, but they never explain why.\n\n- The fucking 1st person camera angles. Oh my God. Because they can't have multiple alien kills or any kind of firearm violence, they attempt to up the scares with first person shots of the alien chasing people.

    "body": "Dexter season eight is awful.  It is so bad, that if there were a real life Dexter his first priority would be murdering everyone responsible for the travesty of season eight.  And I weep daily that there is not a real life Dexter.\n\nI am going to mention some events from the season.  I'm not calling these \"spoilers\" because that would imply that there was something to spoil.  Instead, I'm calling these \"saviors\" because I hope it ruins the plot and saves someone else from wasting their time with this idiotic show.\n\nLets start with what a good show is.  Dexter is a \"Dark Drama\" - and what I expect from this kind of show is, in a metaphor, a killer whale.  The whale is sleek and smooth in the same way that the show should be viscerally.  The whale is dangerous and the show should take risks and push boundaries.  The whale is subtle, a four and a half ton animal swimming at thirty miles an hour under the calm surface of the water - until the whale decides to let you see his dorsal.\n\nThe archetypal scene of season eight, was the one with Hanna McKay and that private detective on the bus.  Hanna injects the detective and tells him \"I've just given you a sedative, you'll wake up in a couple hours\".  Why did she say this?  I'll go through a few possible reasons.\n\n1. The character would have?  No.  Absolutely not.  Hanna is a subtle poisoner.  Announcing on a crowded bus, and in the company of a child, that you have just poisoned someone is not only reckless and idiotic (we know how this poison works, the guy is already zonked out, she is explaining to no one), but it is also anathema to her character.  She would want to keep things quiet and secret.\n\n2. The viewer needed the exposistion?  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Someone entirely unfamiliar with the series, watching that clip on mute would have been able to tell the relevant details.  She injects the guy, he passes out, she escapes.  Yup.  Plus, the Dexter viewer is intimately familiar with how this poison works.\n\n3. The show wants to make it painfully clear that Hanna (despite being a serial killer) isn't killing the guy now that she is a love interest.  Sadly, this is the correct answer.\n\nAt this point, the show has been neutered.  Any kind of danger or risk taking in terms of plotting elements is gone.  Hanna is the good person now, only doing good things.  She would never kill anyone and the show will use retard gloves to pointless drive that into you.\n\nContrast this with the scene in Breaking Bad were Lydia comments that there is only a single packet of Stevia remaining.  This scene feels like the lurch of an unexplained ripple beneath your life raft in the midst of still waters.  Dexter season eight is like they ranked all the Dexter fanfiction that existed and then decided to film one, but they accidentally chose from the bottom of the list instead of the top.\n\nWhere once the show was clever, it became bumbling and hamfisted.  Dexter can't do anything right.  Constantly failing to kill people he should, making mistakes, never learning from his actions.  Oh, taking this boy murderer under your wing now buddy?  HOW MANY FUCKING TIMES HAS THAT FAILED FOR YOU BY NOW?  Wants to kill Hanna, can't.  Wants to kill so and so.  Can't.  Wants to blah blah blah.\n\nThe narrative is clumsy and jagged.  The motivations of characters reverse for no real reason.  Deb wants to kill Dexter all of a sudden.  Nope, changed her mind, helping him again.  Now she is dead.  Dexter wants to live with Hanna, nope now he wants to kill himself now that Deb is dead.  Nope, he survived driving his boat through a hurricane and is now a logger.  There is a dangerous brain surgeon serial killer.  Nope, he is caught.  Now free again cause Dexter can't kill him.  Now caught, nope free.  Dexter has a new love interest, nope she is dead.  And on and on and on.  How are Masuka and his daughter getting along now?  Oh she uses drugs!\n\nThe show always struggled to be plausible, but in season eight it doesn't even bother trying.  Why is Hanna staying at your sister's house?  Why doesn't she wear a fucking wig when she goes out?  Again, look at the efforts they go to in Breaking Bad to disguise themself.  Now imagine Hanna walking into a hospital with no disguise AND GIVING THE ADDRESS WHERE SHE IS CURRENTLY STAYING! Why are you getting romantically involved with a serial killer whose MO is killing her partner?  And you left your son with her?  Great thinking Dex.\n\nI didn't watch Dexter to see the bumbling misadventures of a limp dicked blood spatter analysist as he just wants to be happy with his girlfriend.  I watched it because Dexter was a cool, powerful monster in plain sight.  The story was smart and felt like it was going places.  Season eight is like a parody of Dexter that forgot that parodies were supposed to at least be funny.",

They also aren't going to assume that A needs to hear a clear 'no i will not have sex with you tonight' in order to avoid sex. Do you say that to everyone you meet just in case they get confused and think you want it? No, consent needs to be enthusiastic. For A to have any defense, B would have at one point need to actively engage in the idea of banging which clearly didn't happen. \n\nLater B is so drunk that they black out. At this point, and even before, people are unable to consent to sex. Even if they say yes, it doesn't count because alcohol. At this point if anyone has sex with B it's pretty much rape (unless you get into the confusing situation where the other person was as drunk and both parties were fully involved in the act)\n\nA is possibly also drunk, but clearly able to still move around. A friend, C, witnesses B pretty much passed out and unresponsive while A performs oral sex.

A had already asserted their intentions, and B theirs. They conflicted yet A has ignored this.\n\nFurther evidence is that, while B wakes up unable to form words or thoughts, A is already up and driving. This indicates enough disparity between their drunkeness that A is entirely culpable for what happened.\n\nMaybe if sober A wouldn't have done it. But do we excuse men who hit their wives only when drunk? Or people who murder under the influence of crazy drugs? No, A's state does not impact the fact they committed a crime.",

He reversed to them, tried to open his door, but it shut back on him because he didn't have room to open it. So, Wilson grabbed Brown by the neck from his window and started lecturing him, though no one is sure of their conversation, this is when the scuffle started.\n\nThis cop didn't use his speaker or lights or follow any normal police procedures to let these guys know what was going on.

Obviously police cannot arbitrarily search people and places without a warrant or proper suspicion, which is part of our system of due process.\n\nHowever, if an individual is innocent and happens to match the profile of a suspect that just fleed the scene of a crime nearby, running away or tussling with the cop is not the appropriate response. There is a legal process to handle this. If someone just robbed a bank—or a convenience store—for example, the police should not just give up because the suspect isn't going to play nice and submit to questioning or arrest. If this happened, criminals would always just run away, and the police would be powerless because to do anything more would be to \"escalate.\"\n\nMichael Brown did not want to go to jail for what he had just done, I would imagine. In all likelihood, if he had submitted to arrest, he would have been in jail for a few hours—or a few days max until he was bailed out—and then given a fine, community service, and probation (of course he may have feared he'd spend the next six months in jail); his crime was not the most serious. Unfortunately, if the testimony and gunshot evidence is indeed all accurate, he doubled down on the stupid and decided to fight back against the police officer.",

Simply put, you can't place an expectation of optimal action on the main character, and you can't keep putting yourself in their shoes. To me, it's almost evidence that you want to like Kirito more than you do. Additionally, a lot of people overestimate Kirito's power level; he's about on level with Asuna for the entire game. Notably in the Death Scythe fight, he can't handle the boss and needs to 2v1 it with Asuna. Additionally, Klein and others are around the same strength level but simply don't have Kirito's reflexes or resolve, which he's honed through being a solo player.\n\nHe mentions something something about a support network and players banding together, and they do (the Army for instance, and the blacksmith dude who spends all of his profits helping level mid-level players), and he just missed that because our protagonist plays solo and the show lightly touches on all of those aspects.",

Broly isn't part of it, and Baby/DBZ GT is out.\n\nWhat we *do* have is a huge theme and one single direct line, given by Goku: *The greater the opponent, the more I rise up.* (or something to that effect). In other words, he matches new challenges. \n\nIf you take a look at the Saiyans, they were all weaker than Frieza's main henchmen until Goku and Vegeta started 'rising up to meet the challenge' on a one-on-one basis against each other and against enemies like Pui Pui, Dodoria, Zarbon, and then the Ginyu Force. Every single one of these fights ended in severe injury and near death, but then an opportunity for Zenkai followed.\n\nThere's a small window of opportunity in a race that gets stronger in response to challenges. If the enemy is too weak, then there's no advancement; if the enemy is too strong, the Saiyan just dies.\n\nThus, Goku and Vegeta (and their children) are not exceptions to the rule at all, but rather extremely lucky to progressively face tougher foes on a step by step one-on-one basis.\n\nYou can see this window of opportunity *being missed* when Vegeta powers up after the Ginyu Force fight and is able to match first-form Frieza. Frieza transforms and gets stronger, and Vegeta simply loses. He survives with Dende's healing, and would be able to match second and third form Frieza for sure - but he fails again! Because Frieza's final form is just too strong. This is how most Saiyans would meet their end. He just happens to be revived by the Dragonballs later.\n\nSo the Saiyan race would not have simply all continued to get stronger to the point of threatening the universe. A great many of them would have gotten in fights over their heads and died; more would have picked on weaker races and failed to advance. Only a very small number of procedurally lucky fighters advance to levels like Goku and Vegeta.\n\nIn fact, Goku and Vegeta's luck ran out. They both died at various points. It's only the Dragonballs that are truly responsible for continuing their step-by-step slightly-stronger-enemy faceoffs. What we witness in DBZ is a race's tragic cultural flaw getting them into fights over their capabilities until they all get killed. Fighting people stronger than you is a Saiyan's best opportunity for advancement *and* greatest risk. Eventually, your luck runs out, and Saiyans were culturally bred to just be okay with that fact.\n\nFrieza couldn't count on luck, though. He saw their Zenkai enemy-matching ability and destroyed them to completely prevent it from getting out of control.",

There is a mountain of circumstantial evidence (but no direct evidence) suggesting that McNally deliberately deflated the Patriots footballs, and that Tom Brady knew about it.\n2. The Patriots footballs were not deflated.\n\nThese points are diametrically opposed and mutually exclusive. Only one of those two things is true.\n\nYou detailed all the aspects of Point #1. It's an incredibly compelling story, filled with drama. There's a villain, there's a conspiracy, there's a fall from grace. It's awesome.\n\nPoint #2 is much more mundane. The Patriots balls were at 12.50 PSI before the game, they lost 1.01 PSI due to the cold weather, and that's that. It's a boring explanation.\n\nIt's science versus faith.\n\nPoint #1 has a lot of vague inferences that you can interpret however you like. You choose to interpret them to mean that footballs were deflated; I interpret them another way. Regardless of interpretation, the story doesn't have an \"I prefer footballs below 12.5\", or \"I'll deflate the footballs\", or security footage of deflation, or a confession, or any witnesses at all. There is no direct evidence. You can make your interpretations, and have faith that they're correct.\n\nPoint #2 is pure science. According to the Ideal Gas Law, the Patriots footballs should have lost between 0.98 and 1.18 PSI during the first half *if they were not deflated*. They lost 1.01 PSI. Therefore, they were not deflated.\n\nI'm not trying to change your view, I just want to point out the difference between the groups, and make it clear which group you are in.",

    "body": "I thought Alien 3 was a good sequel. CMV\n\nI'll try and justify it with these reasons (which also stop many of the arguments I usually hear against it)\n\n* The soundtrack was just amazing, the slow paces for moving scenes and the impending crescendo for when Weyland Yutani arrives was some of the best I've ever heard (Eg, [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ckg2RaCpTI#t=158))\n\n* The death of Newt and Hicks... boy oh boy is this a tough one to defend. Although it makes Aliens seem pointless, an earlier draft of the script shed some good light on it: Newt was going to be a host to an alien, and would have died in either agony of her chest exploding or her surroundings exploding - instead her last memories and feelings were safety and security in the Sulaco, and she would've died in peace. The same can be said for Hicks. From a practical standpoint, it also helped move the script along - if they had both survived, how many other ways could a potential sequel 'end' without Ripley saving Newt? It also fits the Alien franchise rather well - the Xenomorphs being without conscience or remorse, taking away everything. \n\n* It was the most original of the Alien movies. Out of the 4 sequels, how many ended with Ripley blasting the last Alien out of a spaceship? The first, second, and fourth (If you'd call that a xeno) Rather than copy the first two films, it went down a different direction with a dark prison-y environment. A bald Ripley certainly made for a different change (Her hair is almost a metaphor, long for innocence in Alien, short for anxiety and confidence in Aliens and no more for Alien^3 , showing she had lost it all and accepted it), this one brought closure for Ripley. \n\n* She was finishing off the Xeno's by killing herself and spiting the company that made her lose everything trying to get it, the most sensible and plausible ending in a universe like this\n\n* The cast was great. From everyday truckers to cocky marines, a British cast of prisoners was a great idea for the next installment. ~~Tywin Lanister~~ Charles Dance made an excellent addition to cast as well as Charles Dutton, along with other heavyweights like Pete Postlethwaite in the mix. The funeral scene was the most poignant moment in the whole series IMO.\n\n* The sets and backgrounds looked great, despite the actual alien. Yes I will admit the Alien looked very CGI (although it was a puppet added over the film), the brooding planet and almost goth-like prison halls were a nice theme and very fitting for a murky alien.\n\n* The alien itself made for a smart change too. From a general soldier to a Queen, the 'runner' or dog/ox-alien was an interesting take on it. (And would also become cannon regarding aliens taking on their hosts form for the expanded universe)\n\n* One of the most important things I noted about it was the genuine reactions people have to it. When watching Alien people would exclaim \"Man I'd *shit* my pants in that situation\" or in Aliens they would cry \"WHOO GAME OVER MAN BREAK OUT THE BIG GUNS\" but would react exactly as intended to Alien^3 like they were in the movie. \n* As for the plothole about the eggs on the Sulaco, I think the Queen in extenuating circumstances would lay a few eggs as an emergency safeguard for the population. One would certainly be a Queen with a few others to guard it. These eggs did not have time to mature like the ones in the Queen Sack (ick) So after a while in the landing gear on the dropship, these eggs may be wired to actively search nearby hosts due to the urgency. *OR* they may have been moved by an automated system on the Sulaco to move organic material, even the possibility the company intended this from long distance.\n\n* Although the first two movies are fantastic, they could be a little bit limited at times - if you step back to look at it, the ending of Aliens with Ripley fighting off a Queen with a free tail and arms should be impossible, but was overlooked cause she was being a hero. In this movie she was a lot more human.\n\n* Not necessarily horror or action, I think this is almost borderline Sci-Fi Drama\n\nAll in all I thought it was a worthy sequel to the first two and concluded the series nicely. Alien Resurrection was a bit meh, no where near the same par.",
