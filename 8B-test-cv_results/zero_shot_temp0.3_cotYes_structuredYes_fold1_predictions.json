    "body": "A while ago around my junior / senior year in high school  we ha to do some sort of community service (being a catholic school and all). So i ended up doing some volunteer work at a homeless shelter. Now before this my experience with people who were homeless was very limited and i would say a bit negative. Homeless people. Seemed to me as just people who were drug addicts / alcoholics / etc. so anyway back to volunteering at the shelter. I ended up talking with a few guys about their lives and pasts and it was fascinating the things that they had done and also the unfortunate circumstances / decisions that led to where they are now. I also ended up playing a 3 hour game of chess which ended in a stalemate. Most of these guys were really intelligent and it surprised me to some degree. Anyway after that my view of those who are homeless has shifted a lot to seeing each person as an individual with their own unique past and not simply as a collective of people who are homeless, and that there are a lot of hard working homeless people out there who have jobs and families but they just can't afford the cost o living.",

It could be violent, it could be a kisser. Just because its a big dog doesnt mean it has more of a right to die for its actions. Should i, as a 240 pound male, be judged to be more violent than a 100 pound woman just from appearance? Just looking at us you would say i am more of a threat, but if after 3 minutes conversation you realize she is a serial killer and i am a teddy bear you will feel ridiculous for your earlier assumption. It is fine to make this assumption, it is not fine to act on it without information. If you saw me and said woman in a fight you would immediately target me, not realizing she is the dangerous one. It is a cops job to not fuck up like this.",

You are going to be running off of instinct, it's like how a drowning man will try to pull down someone who is trying to save him. Also, I've heard that since there aren't any certifications for martial arts, it's a big issue that there are scams which aren't really teaching anything useful but this was from a cracked article so take it with a grain of salt.\nWell the thing is, Trayvon probably wasn't but that doesn't mean Zimmerman is lying. He was placed in a high stress situation and it isn't unreasonable that he could have thought trayvon was reaching for his gun for whatever reason. In hindsight, this might not have been true but self-defense claims don't require him to have perfect knowledge of the situation.",

    "body": "My most recent high school reunion was canceled due to lack of interest. The senior class president, who is in charge of organizing reunions, had to write a refund check to everyone who had already purchased a ticket. I know that at least 50 people paid for tickets. So that means she has 50+ checks floating around out there for over $1,000. These checks do not show up on your online account statements until they have been cashed or deposited. \n\nYou might think people would go deposit these checks right away, but people are weird. Sometimes people wait weeks or even months to deposit a check. They just keep forgetting or something, I don't know. Anyway, that is a long enough time that you can't keep a rough mental record of what checks have been cashed and what checks are still out there. \n\nAlso, you have no control over *when* the checks get cashed. With your debit card, you know if you are running low. So you know not to use it. If you are running low and 10 people decide to cash their checks at once, you will get slammed with bounced check fees. \n\n----\n\nedit: It might not seem like a big deal now, but I write a lot more checks now that I am out of school.",

    "body": "But that's precisely the point.  The difference in age of someone, say, 45 versus someone who is 49 is not going to be as vast as the difference between someone 12 and 16.  Both are 4 year age gaps, but the contrast is much sharper for the lower age pair.  Most people wouldn't bat an eye at, say, the 45 year old and the 49 year old getting into a relationship, but a 12 and a 16 year old in a relationship would be considered odd/wrong/etc.  Why?  Because a dearth in years means a lot more at that age.\n\nIt's not to say a 16 is fully mature, or isn't changing, or has nothing left to learn.  Far from it.  It just that it's even more amplified for someone even younger.  The average 16 year old would be much more mentally equipped to handle the stress and pressure of having to save the world than a 12 year old.  \nSure -- to a point.  If, say, one of your parents pass away when you are 12, it can certainly cause you to \"grow up\" faster, but it doesn't mean you're suddenly as mature as an adult.  Indeed, kids growing up in a wartime situation are probably going to be a bit more mature than similarly aged peace time kids, but they aren't adults by any stretch of the imagination. \n\nAt the same time, kids say some poignant things from time to time, and if a kid was raised by monks I'm sure their outlook would be heavily influenced by that.  Further, he is the reincarnation of the avatar.  He has no shortage of experience to draw from, and I don't think it always has to be in some dramatic fashion when he does so.  \n\nBasically, I don't really see any major plot holes/issues by having kids that understand the urgency of an important mission but still fall prey to the inexperience of their years.  I mean, like, watch a TED talk of some 14 year old trying to do something crazy/cool like provide cheap/clean water for people in Africa.  On one hand they certainly understand the gravitas of the water situation, want to help out, etc.  On the other hand, watching them present their findings/research/product clearly shows that at the end of the day they are still a young (or relatively young) child.  I don't see cognitive dissonance when I watch TLA because I know that kids *can* be simultaneously mature and immature.  \nI disagree.  Toph was very clearly demonstrated as having a rough and tumble demeanor, and yet was still sensitive and kind underneath.  Kids show writing aside, I don't believe Toph would be capable of killing someone in cold blood -- not at the age of 12 anyway.  \n\nI like Korra and the series, but I think TLA was better written.  If I had to take a stab at explaining why I think that, its that I felt TLA was more free to explore the world of Avatar, while LOK is confined to certain parameters set forth by TLA.  To me it's like the same reason fan fiction is never really as good as the original.  It doesn't mean none of it is enjoyable, but they are writing essentially a derivative work that has to fit in the confines of the existing world.  I'm sure they can certainly take some liberties, but the pioneering is largely done.  \n\nFor a more explicit example, take Harry Potter.  I'm guessing there's a good chance you've read them.  But in any event, while subsequent works can certainly be enjoyable and fun to read, any author (including Rowling herself) is bound by the original rules of the original series.  Any written work in that universe cannot (figuratively) be allowed to negate or trivialize previous struggles by inventing new stuff.  That is, if some later work introduced a new spell that would have trivialized Harry's struggles in the original 7 books, that's going to be *really* bad writing.\n\nThe same applies to LOK in my mind.  Not that it's written poorly, but now that TLA is canon, the writers have to be careful not to override anything (at least not without significant explanation/retconning).",

MisanthropeX touched on that, but you did a better job explaining why Arvo's actions towards you don't make as much sense depending on Clem's actions (poor storytelling on Telltale's part?).  \n\nBut I'm still not convinced he's a terrible person.  \nNot \"sad\", more \"angry.\" Kind of like Lilly.  \nChrista also had history with Clem, so she knows that Clem didn't intend for Omid to die.  \nBut in Arvo's case, strangers (who almost robbed and killed him), killed his entire group and beat him up several times. He didn't hate Mike or Bonnie; only Kenny (for obvious reasons) and Clementine (who killed his sister, and though even as you mentioned she didn't necessarily do anything wrong towards him afterwards, you never really got to make up with him like others did - thanks Telltale!).  \nHe did unto you what you basically did to him.   \nReally? I think everyone was reasonable to fear Kenny by that point. Except leaving the house with all your supplies was a dick move, but not trusting Kenny anymore wasn't wrong.

Maybe you didn't suffer in the same way as Holden when you were a child.  Maybe you have a different kind of coping strategy, a different kind of resilience.
